MOSCOW \u2014 Russia on Friday proposed extending a soon-to-expire nuclear arms treaty for one year without any changes, a move seen in Washington as a tactic to delay action on the treaty until after the American presidential election. The Trump administration swiftly dismissed Moscow\u2019s proposal as a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d The Russian offer came just two days after the Kremlin rejected as \u201cnonsense\u201d what the Trump administration hailed as a tentative deal to salvage the pact, the New Start treaty, the last remaining major arms control pact between the two biggest nuclear powers. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, who had previously pushed hard for a five-year extension of the accord, made the surprise proposal during a videoconference with his Kremlin Security Council, saying it would be \u201cextremely sad if the treaty ceased to exist.\u201d While boasting that \u201cwe clearly have new weapons systems that the American side does not have, at least not yet,\u201d Mr. Putin cast his offer as a gesture of good will toward \u201call states of the world that are interested in maintaining strategic stability.\u201d A one year-extension, he added, would allow for \u201cmeaningful negotiations\u201d to continue up to and possibly beyond early February, when the current treaty expires. It would also mean Russia could well be negotiating with a new United States president less hostile to the terms of the original Obama-era treaty than President Trump has been. The offer drew a cool reception in Washington. Within hours, the Trump administration issued a statement from Robert C. O\u2019Brien, the national security adviser, rejecting the offer from the Russian president. \u201cPresident Putin\u2019s response today to extend New Start without freezing nuclear warheads is a non-starter,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThe United States is serious about arms control that will keep the entire world safe. We hope that Russia will reevaluate its position before a costly arms race ensues.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien repeated the administration\u2019s proposal to extend New Start for one year, \u201cin exchange for Russia and the United States capping all nuclear warheads during that period.\u201d The proposal to cap all nuclear warheads would expand New Start beyond strategic weapons, its current focus, to also cover tactical nuclear warheads. Russia considers this a ploy to hobble a new generation of weapons in whose development in recent years Mr. Putin has invested large amounts of money and pride.  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, was involved in the negotiation of   and has indicated that, if elected, he would agree to a straightforward, five-year extension and work later to expand its scope. Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian Legislature\u2019s international affairs committee, said Mr. Putin\u2019s proposal would remove pressure for a deal before the accord expires and disentangle arms talks from pre-election politics in the United States. The Trump administration has balked at agreeing to a five-year extension without revisions, an option provided for in the original treaty and one that would not require Senate approval. Mr. Trump has deemed that unacceptable because the treaty signed by President Obama did not cover all of Russia\u2019s nuclear arms, or any of China\u2019s. China, however, has refused to join any revised version of New Start, arguing that its nuclear arsenal is tiny compared with those of the United States or Russia. While eager to salvage New Start, Russia has shown little interest in giving President Trump a foreign policy victory ahead of a United States presidential election now less than three weeks away, indicating, perhaps, that it expects Mr. Biden to win.   on claims on Tuesday by Mr. Trump\u2019s lead negotiator, Marshall Billingslea, of an \u201cagreement in principle, at the highest levels of our two governments, to extend the treaty.\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, dismissed this as fantasy. \u201cWashington is describing what is desired, not what is real,\u201d Mr. Ryabkov, Russia\u2019s chief negotiator, said in a statement. Russia\u2019s open mockery of the supposed deal, however, left Moscow looking churlish and risked compromising Mr. Putin\u2019s longstanding efforts to present his country as deeply committed to arms control \u2014 in contrast to the United States, which has walked away from a number of accords in the past. Mr. Putin\u2019s proposal on Friday, said Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center and a veteran foreign policy analyst, suggested an attempt to correct any damage to Russia\u2019s image from this week\u2019s dispute, more than an offer with a real chance of being accepted. \u201cIt is just a public relations shot in the direction of discussion in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trenin said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt just returns the ball to the U.S. and not much more.\u201d David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Weston, Vt. and Michael Crowley contributed from Washington. "},
{"text": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s Friday night in Moscow, and popular bars and restaurants in the city center are packed. No one except the staff is wearing a mask or bothers to keep their distance. There is little indication at all that Russia is being swept by a resurgence of coronavirus infections.  \u201cI believe that everyone will have the disease eventually,\u201d says Dr. Alexandra Yerofeyeva, an internal medicine specialist at an insurance company, while sipping a cocktail at The Bix bar in Moscow. She adds cheerfully: \u201cNothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d The outbreak in Russia this month is breaking the records set in the spring, when a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus was put in place. But, as  , authorities in Russia are resisting shutting down businesses again. Some regions have closed nightclubs or limited the hours of bars and restaurants, but few measures have been implemented in Moscow, which is once again the epicenter of the surge.  On Friday, Russian authorities reported over 15,000 new infections, the highest daily spike so far in the pandemic. Moscow \u2014 with less than 10% of the population \u2014 accounts for up to 30% of new infections each day. The health minister says 90% of hospital beds for coronavirus patients have been filled. Three times this week, Russia\u2019s daily death toll exceeded the spring record of 232. Even these soaring virus tolls are likely undercounts; experts have cautioned that official figures around the world understate the true toll, but critics have  , alleging authorities might be playing down the scale of the outbreak. Right now, situation is \u201cdifficult\u201d but \u201cno restrictive measures for the economy are required,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova told President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The spring lockdown hurt the country\u2019s already weakened economy and compounded Russians\u2019 frustration with plummeting incomes and worsening living conditions, driving Putin\u2019s approval rating to a historic low of 59% in April, according to the Levada Center, Russia\u2019s top independent pollster. Analysts say his government doesn\u2019t want to return to those darks days. \u201cThey know that people have just come to the end of their tolerance of the lockdown measures that would be hugely unpopular if they got imposed again,\u201d said Judy Twigg, a professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University, specializing in global health. In fact, Putin\u2019s government appears to be moving in the opposite direction. Russian officials announced this week that air traffic would resume with three more countries. All international air traffic was stopped in the spring. The announcement reminded people \u201cabout the necessity to take care of their health as much as possible\u201d \u2014 a reflection of Russian authorities\u2019 new effort to shift much of the responsibility for how the outbreak unfolds onto the people. Moscow has taken the necessary measures, \u201cbut without the people responding to these measures, helping themselves and the people around them, nothing will work,\u201d warned Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of the Russian capital of 12.7 million. During the summer, authorities lifted most virus-related restrictions, and life in Russia started getting back to normal. Perhaps too quickly, some critics said, noting that the government was eager to ensure that people voted on constitutional amendments extending Putin\u2019s rule. Even as health officials still report several thousand new infections every day, restaurants and cinemas reopened, vacationers flocked to Black Sea resorts, and 17,000 took part in the Moscow Half Marathon in August. Russia\u2019s Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin said the race \u201cmarked this victory\u201d over the pandemic. That same month, Putin announced regulatory approval of the first vaccine against coronavirus \u2014 although   and it is now being tested in a larger study. Authorities are offering it to doctors and teachers, but it\u2019s not widely available.  With Putin\u2019s approval ratings on the rise again, the government appears reluctant to do anything that might further weaken the economy and anger the public. The authorities understand that \u201cthe economic virus is worse than the biological one,\u201d Boris Titov, Russia\u2019s business ombudsman, told entrepreneurs this week. Nearly 70% of the country\u2019s businesses \u201cwill not survive the second wave\u201d and the accompanying restrictions, he said.  But doctors and experts are sounding the alarm that Russia\u2019s health system is being stretched. Just like in the spring, media report hourslong waits for ambulances and long lines for CT scans. People who have virus symptoms \u2014 who are supposed to call a visiting doctor service \u2014 report waiting days for anyone to arrive. \u201cWhen it comes to the regions (beyond Moscow), we see that they are already choking,\u201d said Vasily Vlassov, public health expert with the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Moscow hospitals, so far, appear to be coping.  \u201cThe hospital is full, but there are free beds for now, and we haven\u2019t yet used all of the reserve beds,\u201d said Dr. Alexander Vanyukov of the Moscow Hospital No. 52. Life outside hospitals remains largely normal. Moscow officials have recommended the elderly and those with chronic illnesses stay home. They ordered employers to make 30% of their staff work from home, extended the fall school vacation by a week and moved middle and high school students to online classes. As at the national level, officials have focused on personal responsibility, at one point sending inspectors to theaters to look for retirees who are not self-isolating. Officials said they considered shutting bars and nightclubs, but on Thursday Moscow\u2019s mayor proposed \u201can experiment\u201d instead: Employees and customers at establishments open between midnight and 6 a.m. must register for contact tracing purposes. Margo Lankina, manager of The Bix bar, says operating during the pandemic isn\u2019t easy. Her staff must wear gloves and masks and their health is monitored. The venue is regularly cleaned.  \u201cBut on the other hand, it\u2019s good that they allow us to work,\u201d Lankina says.  \u201cOur guests? Well, the distance is not being observed, that\u2019s true, what can I say?\u201d Lankina admits. \u201cBut somehow we keep on living.\u201d Associated Press writer Kostya Manenkov contributed.

Please give now to support our work  Unlawful Attacks on Hospitals, Schools, Markets Forced Idlib Population Out  The Syrian and Russian armed forces\u2019 repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure in Idlib in northwest   were apparent war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Dozens of unlawful air and ground strikes on hospitals, schools, and markets from April 2019 to March 2020 killed hundreds of civilians. The attacks seriously impaired the rights to health, education, food, water, and shelter, triggering mass displacement. Syrian and Russian Strikes on Civilian Infrastructure Download the full report in English Annex I: Table of Strikes Documented by Human Rights Watch Annex II: Human Rights Watch Letters to the Governments of Syria and Russia Annex III: Confirmation of Receipt from Russian Government ,\u201d details abuses by Syrian and Russian armed forces during the 11-month military campaign to retake Idlib governorate and surrounding areas, among the last held by anti-government armed groups. The report examines the abusive military strategy in which the Syrian-Russian alliance repeatedly violated the laws of war against the 3 million civilians there, many displaced by fighting elsewhere in the country. It names 10 senior Syrian and Russian civilian and military officials who may be implicated in war crimes as a matter of command responsibility: they knew or should have known about the abuses and took no effective steps to stop them or punish those responsible. \u201cThe Syrian-Russian alliance strikes on Idlib\u2019s hospitals, schools, and markets showed callous disregard for civilian life,\u201d said  , executive director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe repeated unlawful attacks appear part of a deliberate military strategy to destroy civilian infrastructure and force out the population, making it easier for the Syrian government to retake control.\u201d Human Rights Watch documented 46 air and ground attacks, including the use of cluster munitions, that directly hit or damaged civilian objects and infrastructure in Idlib in violation of the laws of war. The strikes killed at least 224\u00a0civilians and wounded 561. These were only a fraction of the total attacks during that time in Idlib and surrounding areas. The offensive displaced 1.4 million people, most in the final months of the operation. How five researchers exposed the abusive military strategy behind repeated attacks on civilians in northern Syria \u2014 without ever visiting the sites. Explore a new interactive feature and learn how we reached the truth.\u00a0 Human Rights Watch interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses of the 46 attacks, as well as healthcare and rescue workers, teachers, local authorities, and experts on the Syrian and Russian militaries. Human Rights Watch also examined dozens of satellite images and over 550 photographs and videos taken at the attack sites, as well as logs of flight spotters. Human Rights Watch provided a summary of its findings and questions to the Syrian and Russian governments but has not received a response. The documented strikes, most in and around four urban areas \u2013 Ariha, Idlib City, Jisr al-Shughour, and Maarat al-Nu\u2019man \u2013 damaged 12 healthcare facilities and 10 schools, forcing them to shut down, in some cases permanently. The attacks also damaged at least 5 markets, 4 displaced people\u2019s camps, 4 residential neighborhoods, 2 commercial areas, and a prison, church, stadium, and nongovernmental organization office. Human Rights Watch found no evidence of military objectives, including personnel or materiel, in the vicinity at the time of any of the attacks, and no residents interviewed knew of any advance warning. The overwhelming majority of attacks were far from active fighting between Syrian government forces and anti-government armed groups. The repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure in populated areas in which there was no apparent military objective suggests that these unlawful attacks were deliberate. The attacks appear intended to deprive civilians of the means to sustain themselves and to force them to flee, or to instill terror in the population, Human Rights Watch said. A resident of Idlib City, Ayman Assad, described the impact of the airstrikes: \u201cWe are terrified. I don\u2019t feel safe at my place of work, and at the same time I am constantly worried about my family, especially my two children who are going to school every day. Schools, markets, homes, hospitals, everything is a target. They are targeting life in Idlib.\u201d Most of the attacks documented appeared to involve explosive weapons with wide-area effects in  . The use of such weapons in populated areas can indiscriminately kill and wound large numbers of civilians, and damage and destroy civilian objects and infrastructure. They also have reverberating effects \u2013 disrupting essential services, such as health care, education, and access to food and shelter. Long-term impacts include serious psychological harm to the people affected. Warring parties should avoid the use of these weapons in populated areas, Human Rights Watch said. Prior to a ceasefire in March, government forces regained control of nearly half the territory in and around Idlib, including hundreds of depopulated towns and villages. Since then, some people have returned to areas still controlled by anti-government armed groups, where they found a decimated infrastructure and limited access to food, water, shelter, health care, and education. The Covid-19 pandemic has placed the area\u2019s destroyed healthcare system under immense strain, further imperiling civilians. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President   in getting Turkey, Russia, and Syria to agree to a  Any resumption of fighting would expose civilians to renewed attacks from explosive weapons and the added risk of Covid-19, possibly triggering mass displacement with catastrophic humanitarian consequences. Displaced people could seek to cross Syria\u2019s northern border, where Turkish forces have previously   asylum seekers, Human Rights Watch said. International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, requires all warring parties to direct attacks on military objectives, avoid harming civilians or civilian objects, and not carry out attacks that cause indiscriminate or disproportionate civilian harm. Populations also remain protected by international human rights law, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which protects the rights to health, education, and an adequate standard of living. Given the deadlock within the United Nations Security Council, the General Assembly should adopt a resolution or statement calling on its member states to impose targeted sanctions on those civilian and military commanders credibly implicated in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or other serious violations committed. Concerned governments should pursue criminal cases under the principle of universal jurisdiction and impose unilateral targeted sanctions against commanders and officials implicated in war crimes, including as a matter of command responsibility. To address the humanitarian situation, particularly in light of the pandemic, the Security Council should reauthorize cross-border aid deliveries across all three previously authorized border crossings in the northwest and northeast. If the Security Council proves unable to reauthorize cross-border deliveries due to the threat of veto by Russia, the General Assembly should pass a resolution to support the UN continuing cross-border deliveries to areas not under the Syrian government\u2019s control. \u201cConcerted international efforts are needed to demonstrate that there are consequences for unlawful attacks, to deter future atrocities, and to show that no one can elude accountability for grave crimes because of their rank or position,\u201d Roth said. \u201cAs long as impunity reigns, so too will the specter of renewed unlawful attacks and their devastating human toll.\u201d Syrian and Russian Strikes on Civilian Infrastructure Obstruction of Aid in Yemen During Covid-19 Human Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.

Russia, the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine, is also conducting Phase III trials of Sputnik V in Belarus, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates. RDIF has reached agreements with Indian manufacturers to produce 300 million doses of the shot. A Phase III trial involving 40,000 participants is currently underway in Moscow, with 16,000 people having already received the first dose of the two-shot vaccine.  Interim results are expected to be published in early November. Indian regulators have agreed to incorporate data, provided by Russia on a weekly basis, from the Moscow trial, a source close to the deal told Reuters.

Specifically, they allege that Biden inappropriately leveraged his role as vice president to shut down a criminal investigation into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings to protect Hunter, who was serving on Burisma's board at the time. , there is no evidence that these claims hold merit, and they've been debunked by intelligence assessments, media reports, congressional investigations, and witness testimony. Regardless, the Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory was turbocharged this week, after The New York Post published   purporting to show \"smoking-gun\" emails between Hunter Biden and a senior Burisma executive about setting up a meeting with Joe Biden when he was vice president in 2015. The story was written by a former producer for the Fox News show \"Hannity,\" and Giuliani gave the conservative tabloid the emails featured in the story. Shortly after, it was reported that federal authorities are investigating if the emails were part of a foreign influence operation. To the right-wing political sphere, the story was incontrovertible proof that Trump was right about the Bidens: the president on Wednesday touted the \"explosive documents published by a very fine newspaper\" which he said showed \"that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son's corrupt business dealings.\" But to former intelligence operatives, Giuliani's involvement in the Post's story and Trump's willingness to seize on it showed just how susceptible they are to being duped by hostile intelligence services. Former officials said that Giuliani's proximity to Trump, both men's personality traits, their eagerness to dig up dirt on political opponents, and unwillingness to acknowledge Russian influence make them a goldmine for foreign operatives to exploit. \"This is the most recent edition of what we've seen over four years now with the Trump administration,\" Steve Hall, the former chief of Russia operations at the CIA, told Business Insider. He compared Giuliani to former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was one of Trump's most active surrogates during the 2016 campaign. \"Flynn considered himself the smartest guy in the room and believed the rules didn't apply to him because he was close to the president,\" Hall said. \"Giuliani has the same general profile because he's also someone who thinks he's the smartest guy in the room, politically. And he has protection from the Trump administration. That's exactly the kind of personality that Russian intelligence services would look to take advantage of.\" Glenn Carle, a former CIA covert operative who specialized in turning Russian spies, told Business Insider that in addition to Giuliani's access to Trump, his motivations also make him an attractive target for Russian intelligence. \"No matter what the motivation is, a foreign intelligence service can usually exploit it,\" Carle said. \"In this case, it's very straightforward: Giuliani is hunting for information that he thinks will help Trump and harm Biden. And then you look at the person's psychological makeup. Are they gullible? Can they be duped? Are they motivated to take chances? In Giuliani's case, the answer to all those questions is a glaring 'yes.'\" Giuliani, Carle added, has \"been stumbling around in Ukraine, which is Russian turf from an intelligence perspective. In every way, Trump and Giuliani are grotesquely vulnerable, exploitable targets for Russian intelligence. And any foreign intelligence service would be derelict if they did not try to exploit this.\"  that Russian operatives were using Giuliani to funnel disinformation to Trump. The warning came after intercepted communications showed that Giuliani interacted with multiple people who had ties to Russian intelligence when he traveled to Ukraine in December to look for dirt on the Bidens. Among the people Giuliani met with was a Ukrainian national named Andrii Derkach, a man who has since been   by the Treasury Department for acting as a Russian agent and   about the Bidens and the 2020 election. Giuliani has been reluctant to acknowledge Derkach is a Russian agent and   in an interview Saturday, \"The chance that Derkach is a Russian spy is no better than 50/50.\" The former New York mayor is currently   over whether he violated foreign lobbying laws. And two of Giuliani's Ukrainian associates who helped him in his quest to dig up dirt on the Bidens, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were  On Thursday, NBC News reported that   whether the purported Hunter Biden-Burisma emails featured in the New York Post's story were part of a foreign intelligence operation ahead of the November election.  , \"the probe is part of a larger investigation into Russian disinformation that dates back to before the impeachment inquiry last fall.\" In January, hackers associated with Russia's military intelligence agency  , The New York Times reported. And in September,   the Russians were planning to dump hacked and forged Burisma emails as part of an \"October surprise\" targeting Biden before the election. Later that month, the former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told the New York Post about the existence of emails between Hunter Biden and the Burisma executive. Giuliani gave the conservative tabloid a copy of a hard drive containing the emails on Sunday. He is said to have obtained the hard drive last December from a computer repair shop owner who discovered the emails and other compromising information about Hunter Biden on a water-damaged laptop that someone dropped off but never picked up. When The Daily Beast asked Giuliani if he was concerned the emails may have come from Russia's hack of Burisma, he replied that it \"wouldn't matter\" and asked \"what's the difference?\" Trump, meanwhile, knew for weeks that the New York Post's story about Hunter Biden was coming,  . \"The president knew [in recent weeks] that Rudy had something big coming on the Biden family,\" one source told the outlet. \"I remember hearing\u2026something about files, and corruption, and something about sex and drugs\u2026It was evident that the president was interested and wanted it done before the election.\" Robert Deitz, a former senior lawyer at the CIA who also served as the general counsel at the National Security Agency, told Business Insider that Trump's refusal to condemn Russian election interference and his tendency to   when the topic is raised, show that he's \"not going to ask any questions\" if the Russians try to help his campaign. Giuliani, he said, \"is a lot smarter than Trump but misses being in the limelight and wants to be a power player in Washington. He's an old guy who loves attention. So the Russians can easily get an agent to talk to him, butter him up, and take him out to swishy restaurants. You know, why not?\" Hall echoed that view and described Giuliani as a \"useful idiot\" for Russian operatives. \"The Russians can make Giuliani feel like he's important,\" he said. \"They can appeal to his ego and basically get the same type of control over him that they can with a traditional recruited asset.\" Trump, for his part, has dismissed warnings that the Russians were targeting Giuliani.  , when national security adviser Robert O'Brien and other officials cautioned him about the matter, the president shrugged and said, \"That's Rudy.\" \"At the very least, Giuliani has been directly manipulated and fed information for a substantial period of time,\" Carle said. \"And when confronted with these concerns, both he and Trump aggressively challenge it and denounce those who raised the points. From a counterintelligence perspective, all of that is very alarming and suspicious.\"\u00a0 In all, the polarized political landscape is ripe for foreign intelligence services to conduct influence operations in the midst of a US election. And the US intelligence community   in the election to help the president and hurt his opponent. But this time, Moscow may not have to work as hard to get results.  from the special counsel Robert Mueller, the Russians took time to establish fake social media accounts, build up a following, and use that to sow discord within the American public. The GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, also   to dump thousands of emails via WikiLeaks that Russian hackers had stolen when they breached the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign. But in the last four years, the Russians \"have learned they don't have to put that much time and effort into this because we're doing a lot of their work for them,\" Hall said. \"Whether it's the New York Post or Fox News or whatever, they know all they have to do is get a bit of weird information out there and it'll just go viral and end up in the right-wing media and on the president's Twitter feed.\" \"They want to protect their boy in the White House because Trump's policies have been strategically fantastic for Russia,\" Carle said. \"He alienated the United States from NATO and turned a blind eye to Russian influence in Crimea. His actions in the Middle East, especially in Syria and Libya, helped Russia gain a significant presence in the region for the first time in 48 years.\"  to \"make America dysfunctional because what's bad for America is good for Russia,\" Carle added. \"So if they can sow dissension in our political practices that discredits our institutions and disaffects Americans from participating in the democratic process, then America crumbles.\" \"And that's how Russia wins,\" he said.

Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping,   that China has plans to become carbon neutral by 2060, calling for a \u201cgreen revolution.\u201d If the plan is properly implemented, it could help China to finally shed its biggest-polluter   and significantly improve the global ecosystem, which could also drastically shake up the country\u2019s eminent Bitcoin ( The most well-known mining hub of China is the Southern province of Sichuan, which has an abundant hydroelectricity sector. However, the electricity there is especially cheap  , which takes place between May and September. Outside of that period, most miners migrate up north to Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, which currently generate over 40% of the total Bitcoin hash rate. Unlike Sichuan, however, those desert regions depend mainly on non-renewable sources of energy such as coal. If the government proceeds to push for net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, mining there will become inefficient, and local players will be left with much fewer options. As the world has finally learned the hard truths of climate change and human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide, having constant access to renewable energy is going to become one of the most important factors in Bitcoin mining. But are there any locations that can cater to this requirement? Let\u2019s take a look at the Bitcoin Mining Map that   a close estimate of the geographic distribution of the global BTC hash rate. China, of course, is the uncontested king, making up more than 65%. Following China are the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan, which are neck and neck at 7,24%, 6,90% and 6,17%, respectively. The Commonwealth of Independent States, or the CIS region, which includes both Russia and Kazakhstan, seems to be particularly overlooked by international players, mostly due to a lack of information about local mining scenes. Akin to Northern China, Kazakhstan\u2019s electricity is produced mostly by coal power plants. It\u2019s cheap, but not sustainable. Also, the local government has been interfering with the electricity market by   tariffs and cost, meaning that they might eventually bounce back. Russia, on the other hand, has lots of natural prerequisites for cheap renewable electricity, as well as a more stable economic environment. If you ask me to name one thing that the Soviet Union was good at, I\u2019d say industrial infrastructure. Most of Bitcoin mining in Russia takes place in the famous Siberian region, which has also been a key spot for aluminum production since the 1960s. Because energy is consumed at all stages in the production of aluminum, the USSR chose to build Siberian smelters along with hydropower plants (Russia hosts as much as 9% of the world\u2019s hydro resources, mostly in Siberia and the far east). Aluminum smelting technology has evolved since then, making production much more energy-efficient. That, along with the fact that the Soviet government often left room for future growth when building infrastructure, is the key reason why the region has so much excess power these days.   to RusHydro, the world\u2019s second-largest hydroelectric power producer, the total installed capacity of hydropower units in Russia is currently approximately 45 million kilowatts. More specifically, hydropower plants in Siberia are   to produce almost 10% of the total output of all power plants controlled by the Unified National Energy Network. Another key aspect is Siberia\u2019s infamous climate, where it\u2019s cold nine months of the year. If there\u2019s anything that this kind of weather is good for, it\u2019s hosting a datacenter stuffed with large ASIC units running at full capacity. Anyone who has ever tried running a mining rig at home during summer will likely know what I mean. Russia\u2019s vicinity to China is also a big plus, as the best mining hardware is produced there. Historically, Moscow has had a strong economic relationship with Beijing, which continues to   to this day. The shipping between the two countries is cheap, fast and constant: Freight trains and cargo aircraft continue to run despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, imagine shipping thousands of mining rigs to the state of Texas from Beijing, considering that the U.S. is in a trade war with China and has slapped a hefty 25% tariff on imported mining equipment. Continuing the comparison to the U.S., operating expense and capital expense costs of maintaining a data center are considerably lower in Russia, mostly because local labor and construction costs are cheaper. Furthermore, if your rig breaks down, you don\u2019t even have to send it back to China, wasting several weeks (which is considered ages in Bitcoin mining). Institutional-scale Russian facilities tend to have in-house repair centers with technicians trained directly by top Chinese mining hardware manufacturers, so they can quickly get everything up and running again. Russia has been the third-largest Bitcoin mining country in the world for quite a while now, and the local industry has developed significantly. Hearing all of this for this first time, one might argue:   Well, that\u2019s not factually correct. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the country\u2019s  ,\u201d or DFA, that was signed into law in July. The bill prohibits Russian residents from making payments in cryptocurrencies starting from January 2021 but legally recognizes them as \u201cdigital financial assets.\u201d It does not mention cryptocurrency mining in any form, meaning that currently, there are no legal restrictions.  to amend the DFA law to prohibit miners from receiving payments in crypto for their activities. As the authority reportedly stated:  While no one knows if the amendments will get approved, what they imply is pretty straightforward: Russians can\u2019t sell the coins that they mine, but they can legally host their hardware and other infrastructure for foreign players. Most likely, the change will affect mom-and-pop operations, since large-scale miners are normally paid in fiat currency. Moreover, operations whose clients are overseas can still be legally paid in crypto from abroad even if the proposed bill comes into effect. Besides, regional authorities in Siberia are growing highly supportive of large mining operators because they pay taxes, create jobs, and put that excess energy to use. The truth is that the government is pro-business and has no interest whatsoever in destroying something that contributes to the economy. At this point, the government has already met all the local large-scale mining operators mostly because the consumption of several megawatts of power is easily detectable by the electric grid operator (and naturally requires some sort of explanation). Earlier in August, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media   a proposed bill that would establish additional control over data centers in Russia.  While doing business is never a risk-free activity, especially when it comes to the cryptocurrency industry, there are actually no reported cases of crypto mining-related scams in Russia. The police  , but the authorities never scour compliant operations who pay due taxes and costs. Curiously, most stories about inconsistent mining players come from North America, which is generally considered to be a highly-regulated market. In fact, the region is littered with carcasses of mining companies that either suddenly went bust or turned out to be scams, disappearing with investors\u2019 money in both cases. The most recent example would be the Toronto-based HyperBlock, which abruptly closed down its 20-megawatt data center in May, saying that it had to cease operation due to the Bitcoin halving \u2014 despite the fact that it is a regular event that companies can prepare for well in advance. Similarly, in early 2019, U.S.-based major crypto mining and blockchain firm   after allegedly failing to pay $300,000 in utility bills. Sure, Russia could use some clearer regulation on mining (like most countries in the world), but this process will likely take some time. The most important thing is that the government has finally communicated its general attitude, which could be summarized in the following way:  Consequently, it seems like Russians are getting ready for a mining boom similar to the one that happened in 2017. Local retailers have recently   in August, and GPU sales registered from June to August are up 470% compared to last year, so things are clearly heating up. "},

In some ways, it appears that Russia\u2019s young people may be next. According to  , in the last couple of years, younger Russians have become the group most dissatisfied with Russia\u2019s political system. But the obstacles that have so far kept the country\u2019s millennials and Gen Zers from reforming the system remain. For one, there\u2019s the sheer size of the younger generations, which, thanks to decades of low birth rates, constitute a small minority within Russian society. There simply may not be enough young people to successfully push for fundamental change. Second, many younger Russians refrain from actively participating in politics and only grow more politically engaged as they enter their early 30s. Yet the youth need not despair. Findings from our new study conducted with the Levada Center, an independent survey company, suggest ways in which the United States could help boost higher civic and political engagement in these age cohorts\u2014and, in turn, help them play a similar role as in Russia\u2019s neighboring countries. Several years ago, it was commonplace for concerned observers to   younger Russians, who showed no inclination for challenging Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule, as anti-democratic, deeply conservative, and unprepared to fight for a more open future. Yet today, Russians aged 16-34 are the most   cohort in the country. They also hold   attitudes than the rest of the population, and the number of Russians below the age of 25 who   is almost twice as high as the number of those who prioritize state interests. The opposite is true among older Russians. Younger Russians are also among the most opposition-minded groups in Russia. A steady decline in living standards has   support for the authorities among all Russians, and it isn\u2019t hard to see why. Real incomes in Russia declined every year between 2014 and 2018, when the Russian Federal State Statistic Service   the methodology for income reporting. In 2020, real incomes experienced the biggest   they have seen in the last 20 years due to the pandemic-induced economic crisis. That, combined with an unpopular hike in the retirement age in 2018, has diminished Russians\u2019 faith in their country\u2019s political leaders. The lack of support is most pronounced among younger citizens. In June and July polling, 18- to 24-year-olds were the group most critical of Putin\u2019s rule (49-50 percent disapproved). And in a July study, 62 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds   that Russia was heading in the wrong direction (as opposed to an average of 40 percent across other ages). According to the study, only 7 percent of young Russians   Putin among politicians they trust (as opposed to 23 percent of the   on average). And in August, only 23 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 31 percent of 25- to 39-year-olds surveyed   they would vote for Putin if the elections were to take place the next Sunday, as compared with 40 percent of the population in general. Based on focus group discussions, younger and older Russians seem to share many of the same reasons for their dissatisfaction. These include concerns about Russia\u2019s economic problems and the country\u2019s future. However, there are age-specific issues, too, having mostly to do with younger Russians\u2019 different media habits. In particular, younger Russians are more   to the internet and social networks. YouTube, for example, has   to new public figures, such as the independent journalist and popular video blogger Yuri Dud, and independent politicians including Alexei Navalny. Because of their access to outside sources of information, younger Russians appear less vulnerable to Kremlin TV propaganda. Younger Russians are more positive toward the United States, which is constantly bedeviled by Russian state-controlled TV channels. Older,   Russians (aged 55 and above) are less so. Younger Russians complain more often about restrictions on the internet and popular communications apps like Telegram. They are opposed to the criminal charges that can be waged for reposts and retweets deemed critical of Putin, and they have criticized the growing brutality of the authorities, such as the crackdown on Moscow protesters in the summer of 2019. In focus groups at the end of last summer, young residents from big cities repeatedly mentioned the case of Daria Sosnovskaya, a young woman who was deliberately punched in the stomach by a police officer at one protest. One of the videos that captured this moment gathered over 700,000 views on YouTube. Added together, increasing internet penetration and rising opposition to the authorities among younger Russians could chip away at Putin\u2019s power over the long term. However, several important obstacles remain. First, younger Russians are a minority within the Russian population, and their share keeps declining. According to the 2019 census, Russians aged 15-29   only 16.5 percent of the population due to the relatively small number of children born between 1989 and 2003. As recently as 2010,   made up 24 percent of the population. This number, while significantly   than in many Asian republics in the post-Soviet space, is comparable to  , where 15- to 29-year-olds constitute 17.7 percent. In  , the share of 15- to 24-year-olds is only 9.6 percent. Compounding the challenge of size, young Russians also have low rates of political participation. Surveys show that only about 20 percent of people aged 14-29 are   in politics, and only 7 percent mention active participation in Russia\u2019s political life as a possibility in the future. Younger Russians follow the news and discuss political topics two times   as older ones. They vote in elections of various levels three times less often. Lower interest in politics may explain the fact that, despite their growing dissatisfaction with the authorities, younger people have not increased as a share of all opposition protesters over the last decade. The figure   at about 20-30 percent of protest participants. Instead, younger Russians tend stay politically engaged primarily online. For example, while younger Russians, even more than other age groups,   the constitutional amendments introduced in 2020, which among other changes granted Putin a right to stay in power for two more consecutive terms, they have also disproportionally   from voting during constitutional referenda, including a ballot in July 2020. This is a result of two processes. First, few young Russians thought that their vote would be decisive. Second, continuing disarray within Russia\u2019s opposition prevented it from offering a consolidated strategy for the constitutional amendments voting and mobilizing young Russians to participate. Still, although Russian millennials and Gen Zers are somewhat apolitical at the moment, in Russia interest in politics and in political participation tends to awaken later in life, closer to the age of 25-30. Data from our surveys shows that various indicators of adulthood, such as having a mortgage and kids and living separately from one\u2019s parents, predict higher political engagement among Russians. Until then, younger people tend to borrow politics from the adults who surround them. However, as these generations become more politically engaged, they may come to represent a real obstacle to Putin\u2019s rule\u2014through protests and at the ballot box. Already by 2024 this age cohort may grow to represent a substantial electoral challenge to the regime.  that indicators of civic and political engagement are higher among those Russians between 16 and 34 who speak foreign languages and travel abroad. Other studies have also shown that young respondents who have even a short experience of traveling outside Russia demonstrate higher proclivity for independent thinking. The exposure to different values, norms, and ideas from other countries changes people\u2019s perception of the way things should work domestically. This suggests that fostering educational exchange programs in the United States may be one way to spur political activity among young Russians.  is a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis.  is a deputy director at the Levada Center in Moscow.  is a senior research fellow for the Levada Center.

{"text": "Authorities\u2019 attack on LGBT community turns on men who use surrogacy who are assumed to be gay Last modified on Fri 16 Oct 2020 04.37 BST Several gay men have fled   after officials said that they would arrest people \u201cof non-traditional sexual orientation\u201d who had had children through surrogacy. The announcement formed the authorities\u2019 latest attack on the LGBT community. Surrogacy is legal in Russia but has increasingly been attacked by conservative lawmakers and the Orthodox church. Police arrested a number of top fertility doctors this year and have accused them of \u201cchild trafficking\u201d in an ongoing case. State media recently quoted an unnamed official saying that investigators would widen their investigation into surrogacy to include single fathers, whom the official assumed would be gay. \u201cThey are planning to arrest more suspects, including single Russian men who used surrogate mothers to have babies,\u201d the official said, claiming it was illegal for gay men to have children in this way. Alexander* (name has been changed), a single parent who fled the country shortly after reading that statement, said he knew there was no such law in Russia but could not risk his six-month-old son being taken away from him. The 40-year-old said prosecutors had not contacted him directly but that a source in a doctors\u2019 clinic warned him earlier that investigators had seen his son\u2019s medical records and it looked as if he \u201cwas going to have problems\u201d. He said that when he read that investigators were planning to target single men who had used surrogates: \u201cI thought I\u2019d lost my grip on reality. I thought I wasn\u2019t reading the article properly.\u201d Alexander said he had no plans to return to Russia immediately. \u201cOf course I would like to come home, take my child back to a place he knows, where his grandma and grandpa are nearby.\u201d But he saw little hope of investigators using their \u201ccommon sense\u201d and changing tack. a Russian lawyer, who works in reproductive rights, said he knew of several other single fathers who had left Russia since the comments. \u201cFor these people it\u2019s a disaster. They have a job, house, business, they\u2019ve made their lives in Russia. And now, because they\u2019ve decided to become parents in this country, they have had to take their children, leave everything behind and run into the unknown.\u201d Svitnev himself was a suspect in the \u201cchild trafficking\u201d investigation begun when a baby born to a surrogate mother died of sudden infant death syndrome in January. The baby was being looked after by nannies while his foreign parents were dealing with paperwork to take him home. The lawyer said investigators had turned their attention to single fathers to distract from the fact that they had found \u201cabsolutely nothing, no guilt, no basis for a charge\u201d in the original case. Russia has introduced a raft of anti-LGBT legislation in recent years. State media often present the idea of gay rights as a western import that poses an existential threat to Russia and portray the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as a defender of \u201ctraditional values\u201d. A change to the constitution this summer defined marriage as being between a man and a woman, setting back hopes for marriage equality for at least a generation. Meanwhile parliament is considering a law that would not only bar transgender people from changing their sex on birth certificates, but require those who have already transitioned to change back their status. Exact numbers for children born to surrogate mothers in Russia are not available but experts estimate there are about 3,500 surrogate pregnancies in the country each year. "},
{"text": "The Russian leader claims to be conquering the pandemic, but he inhabits a virus-free bubble, rarely leaving home. The few people he meets must quarantine first. MOSCOW \u2014 The officials from a secretive Russian security force seemed to know exactly what they wanted when they reached out to Olga Izranova\u2019s company last spring. They wanted movable tunnels that douse people in clouds of disinfectant. \u201cThey said it had to be done very fast,\u201d Ms. Izranova recalls. She admits the tunnels are of limited efficacy in the coronavirus pandemic, but for her most important customer, every bit counts. The Federal Protective Service, Russia\u2019s answer to the Secret Service, has helped build a virus-free bubble around President Vladimir V. Putin that far outstrips the protective measures taken by many of his foreign counterparts. Russian journalists who cover Mr. Putin have not seen him up close since March. The few people who meet him face-to-face generally spend as much as two weeks in quarantine first. The president still conducts his meetings with senior officials \u2014 including with his cabinet and his Security Council \u2014 by video link from a spartan room in his residence outside Moscow, which has been outfitted with Ms. Izranova\u2019s disinfectant tunnel. In the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia has often been compared to the United States and Brazil, two other large countries whose leaders have played down the disease\u2019s risk and saw it spiral out of control. But while President Trump and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil have chafed against restricting their own movements, Mr. Putin has retreated into an intricate cocoon of social distancing \u2014 even as he has allowed life in Russia to essentially return to normal. The contrast between the behavior of Mr. Putin and that of his people now looms large, as a second wave of the pandemic threatens to wash over Russia. In Moscow, where people  , the number of daily reported new cases tripled to more than 2,300 in the last two weeks. As Russia lifted last spring\u2019s lockdown, Mr. Putin presided over ceremonial events that seemed designed to exude a sense of normalcy. Behind the scenes, they were anything but normal. Dozens of World War II veterans joined Mr. Putin on the risers in Red Square in June when he presided over   of the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany. But before being allowed within breathing distance of Mr. Putin, the veterans had to spend two weeks in quarantine at an isolated health resort. \u201cWe went for walks, were bored, sat around and breathed the air,\u201d said Lev Litvinov, a 100-year-old veteran. The logistics proved so taxing that Mr. Litvinov did not actually make it to the parade. He said that after spending two weeks in quarantine, he got sick on the winding drive through the countryside toward Red Square, 50 miles away. He was taken instead to a health center, where he spent another week. \u201cMost importantly, this is about their health, the veterans\u2019 health,\u201d Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman,   of the decision to quarantine the attendees. Mr. Putin\u2019s diligence in protecting himself is striking because in communicating with the Russian public in recent months, his government largely declared the virus vanquished. \u201cI would like to congratulate you on our latest joint victory,\u201d Mayor Sergey S.

When Mr. Putin   that Russia had registered the world\u2019s first coronavirus vaccine, it appeared that the country was delivering a final, crushing blow against the pandemic. \u201cThese common efforts and targeted and, as it turned out, very effective solutions have helped us to pass the peak of the epidemic and create conditions for further work,\u201d Mr. Putin   in an interview with state television. Families filled Black Sea resorts and adults returned to their offices. Across the country, children went back to school on schedule on Sept. 1. But Mr. Putin remained in self-isolation. He continued to hold most of his meetings with government officials by video conference from a room in his suburban Moscow estate, Novo-Ogaryovo. The residence, like the Kremlin, has been outfitted with a disinfectant tunnel made by Ms. Izranova\u2019s industrial-cleaning equipment company, Mizotty, in the Russian city of Penza. Walking through the tunnel, she says, feels and smells like passing through a cloud of pool-water mist. Mr. Putin\u2019s video conferencing room \u2014 beige chair, walls, telephones; a Dell computer screen, blank except for a photograph of the Kremlin as the desktop background \u2014 became so familiar that state television  \u201cThese are the microphones on the president\u2019s desk,\u201d the reporter intoned on the Sunday prime time show \u201cMoscow. Kremlin. Putin.\u201d \u201cWhen the indicator lights are red, sound is not transmitted.\u201d That a state television reporter got to visit and interview Mr. Putin in August was an exception. Otherwise, the Kremlin has cut off journalists\u2019 ability to see Mr. Putin in person, even for those who used to do so regularly, since March. \u201cThe work has been absolutely remote,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov, a journalist who has covered the Kremlin for Kommersant, a daily newspaper, since 2002. \u201cI know for a fact that no text journalist, myself included, has seen the president in all the days of the coronavirus.\u201d Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, did not respond to requests for comment about the president\u2019s coronavirus precautions. But Mr. Kolesnikov said he understood that the governors, business leaders and senior officials on Mr. Putin\u2019s agenda are given a choice: meet by video link or spend up to two weeks in quarantine for an in-person encounter. \u201cSince he misses real-life interaction with people, you would probably have the chance to drink tea with him afterward,\u201d in the case of an in-person meeting, Mr. Kolesnikov said. \u201cI think that they, of course, choose quarantine in that situation.\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s extreme caution reflects not only his age \u2014 he is 67, putting him at relatively high risk of severe illness from the coronavirus \u2014 but also what critics describe as paranoia honed during his former career as a K.G.B. spy. He made headlines last year   at the Group of 20 summit in Japan, even as the other assembled world leaders drank from wine glasses. According to the Kremlin\u2019s website, only one person has met with Mr. Putin face-to-face more than once since April: Igor Sechin, a former K.G.B. officer and a close associate of Mr. Putin since the 1990s. He now runs Rosneft, the Russian state oil giant, and saw the president  A Russian investigative news outlet, Proekt,   that the authorities had set aside two large health resorts in the Black Sea city of Sochi for people quarantining before meeting Mr. Putin. In September, 30 nuclear industry workers who had quarantined in Sochi were then flown to Moscow to meet with the president  \u201cSome people quarantine for two weeks, some people quarantine for a few days and some people meet without a quarantine,\u201d Mr. Peskov told reporters in response.

Mr. Peskov hinted this week that the president would only resume foreign travel after he gets a Covid-19 vaccine. But he advised that Mr. Putin was not ready to get the shot yet, despite all the state-media bombast about Russia\u2019s world-leading achievement in developing it. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that when it comes to the head of state, special precautionary measures are in effect,\u201d Mr. Peskov  Oleg Matsnev and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed research.

This highlights the need for America to have a long-term high-technology vision, policy and set of goals in order to make strategic investments that correlate to our way of life, economic well-being, and democratic norms and values to shape not just the next decade but the decades to follow. The United States can either prepare and posture to shape a future with American strategic leadership, or resign itself to follower status. In many possible future scenarios, follower status may mean subservience to authoritarian-led economic systems.\u00a0 The U.S. has seized on such strategic opportunities in the past. At the beginning of World War II, America was still recovering from the Great Depression and possessed the 12th largest army in the world. The government turned to America\u2019s   to help repair the economy and prepare America\u2019s industrial base. This investment and strategic posture produced innovative developments in scientific technologies that ushered in advances in radio, ships, railroads, airplanes, nuclear power, solar power, space flight and, eventually,  Throughout the Cold War, the U.S. depended on Industrial Age policies and mechanisms to support our national defense and maintain an industrial base capable of providing carriers, submarines, bombers, fighters, tanks, ballistic missiles, satellites and other technologies. The Cold War   in the peace dividends of the 1990s.We failed to prepare for how potential adversaries planned to challenge widely accepted norms, values and laws across the world\u2019s land, air, sea, cyber and space domains.\u00a0 During the past decade, China and Russia have acted violently or indiscriminately across these domains by integrating ideological, political, economic, military and technological tools. In part, they are energized by the belief that the U.S. may be overwhelmed with domestic issues and is a spent power in decline.\u00a0 \u201d has declined in part because, for 20 years, the U.S. has focused on countering terrorism, a real but not existential threat, and neglected investments necessary for great power competition. These investments impact our way of life because we are dependent on technology such as cyber,  , machine learning and other emergent technologies \u2014 all part of the incipient Digital Age.\u00a0 The investments needed for great power competition have now surpassed our expenditures on counterterrorism and are starting to resemble Cold War-era figures. However, our economy is severely constricted because of the COVID-19 pandemic. To address these emerging challenges, we must develop innovative ways of thinking and new ways of action while remaining true to our national ethos and role as a strategic power. To do things differently, and to retain U.S. global leadership, we must rebalance from 20th century to 21st century capabilities. The U.S. must build the most advantageous industrial structure with policies that promote our technology industries and broaden our markets. The U.S. must return to publicly financing and providing venture capital investments for basic research, and science and technology innovation.\u00a0 Our global competitors operate under economic policies and practices that disadvantage American companies. The U.S. market-driven system does not benefit from \u201cfree markets\u201d that can be manipulated through the funding schemas and financing that state-controlled systems employ. We already have lost our overall economic advantage, and America\u2019s scientific and technological competitive advantage will be lost in less than a decade to nations that make the necessary investments.\u00a0 We are decades beyond the simpler days of the Sputnik-era but our   in research and development are dismally close to the pre-Sputnik days of more than a half-century ago. America\u2019s private sector cannot make up this difference. Our global competitors are filling that gap by heavily funding innovation research that contributes to their national security and military purposes.\u00a0 With our competitive advantage eroded, we no longer may be capable of deterring other nations from taking actions that will hurt our interests or those of our allies \u2014 who may be pressured by undemocratic powers. Inaction also could increase our margin of error in assessing our adversaries\u2019 intentions and capabilities, resulting in higher risk trade-offs should conflict occur. We must change the way we invest in and employ cutting-edge technologies. Ironically, as mentioned, the United States dominated the Industrial Age precisely because it embraced policies to stimulate economic growth and global competitiveness, especially for critical and emerging industries. America must now rebalance from 20th century to 21st century capabilities by creating the most advantageous industrial structure and policies. Congress and the executive branch secure our future by prioritizing to:\u00a0 America can either evolve to the realities of a new age or waste this decade\u2019s opportunities for strategic leadership in the 21st century. We need a vision and strategy to forge a path to exit great power competition on the top. We must prioritize investing in exponential technologies, instead of focusing on incremental Industrial Age ones with long lead-times that permit our competitors to catch up. The competition may even be over by the time we reap the investment return on the incremental technologies. The United States must be the fastest so we can set the pace and conditions for others to follow, abide and benefit. Our example and leadership must be so profound that great powers and other nations will have no choice but to follow and replicate our success. In doing so, America\u2019s strength would project U.S. leadership in technological innovation, a vibrant market economy and, most importantly, democratic norms and values.

Cyber and disinformation efforts targeting the radical right in the United States remain part of the tool-kit \u2014 a kit that is being used to light the fuse of white supremacy.\" The 2020 presidential election is proving the most contentious in recent history. President Donald Trump has spread groundless accusation that Democrats are plotting to steal the election, and has been   to far-right and white nationalist groups. In turn, they have taken encouragement from the president's anti-immigrant policies and his willingness to stoke white grievances.\u00a0 Far right so-called militia groups   for supporters to monitor polling stations.

For years, ties have been forming between white nationalist groups in the US and Russia, the experts said.   Russia's President Vladimir Putin as a bulwark against what they regard as the forces of decadent liberalism. Neo-Nazi Matthew Heimbach, one of the organisers of the 2017 Charlottesville white nationalist rally,  Alex Newhouse, who researches online white nationalist propaganda, also at Middlebury, said the reverence US white nationalists feel for Russia exposes them to manipulation.\u00a0 \"One of the scariest parts of the developments in the information space and the extremism space over the last five years is the gradual \u2014 the pretty significant but gradual increase in pro-Russian sentiment among American white nationalist groups,\" he said. \"And that is a very specific trend that needs to be addressed. Because it does open them up to influence and manipulation.\" The relationship between Putin's Russia and America's resurgent white nationalists goes further than expressions of admiration or ideological affinity. Experts say that groups have for years been building alliances in an effort to form an international white nationalist movement.\u00a0 One is the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), which in April became the first white nationalist organisation to be  Operating paramilitary training camps outside St Petersburg, the group aims to re-establish the old Tsarist Russian empire. According to  , the group blames western culture for the \"destruction of the family and healthy moral values\" through \"abortion, propaganda of debauchery and acceptance of sexual perversions.\" Heimbach, the Charlottesville organizer, met with RIM leaders in the wake of the rally. They had travelled to the US to broker alliances with white nationalist extremists. Heimbach at the time told   that the movements shared a commitment to \"conservative reactionary politics, spiritual revival, and nationalist principles.\" Blazakis, the academic, said: \"RIM has worked hand-and-glove with US-based white supremacists. \"They've invited US-based far-right ideologues to conferences to exchange ideas and tradecraft.

Business Insider was unable to reach Heimbach for comment.

{"text": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 The European Union and Britain imposed sanctions Thursday on six Russians, some among the highest-ranked officials in the nation, and a state research institute over the nerve agent poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The move comes a day after Russia\u2019s foreign minister threatened the 27-nation EU with retaliatory action. The sanctions had been agreed on by EU foreign ministers on Monday, without names given. \u201cRussia is our neighbor and shares this continent with us, but we will not give up our principles and convictions when it comes to chemical weapons,\u201d French President Emmanuel Marcon told reporters at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels. He said the bloc must continue \u201ca transparent but demanding dialogue\u201d with Moscow. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany, which holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, said that \u201conly with a clear position and by sticking to principles can we as the European Union make progress with respect to Russia.\u201d Those hit by the sanctions, which   in Europe, include Alexander Bortnikov, the chief of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, the top KGB successor agency that is in charge of domestic security, and Sergei Kiriyenko, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s deputy chief of staff. The State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology was also targeted. The EU said that institute, which was responsible for destroying Soviet-era chemical weapon, was years ago involved in the development and production of chemical weapons, including the nerve agent Novichok allegedly used to poison Navalny. The U.K. said it would also apply the EU sanctions and will continue them once it leaves a post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year. \u201cAny use of chemical weapons by the Russian state violates international law. We are determined to hold those responsible to account,\u201d British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator who is Putin\u2019s most visible political opponent, fell ill on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia. He was flown to Germany for treatment two days later and is still recovering there. Last week, tests conducted at labs designated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed that Navalny was poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent. They confirmed results found earlier in labs in Germany and elsewhere. Russian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in the poisoning and Russian doctors who first examined Navalny have said they found no signs of a poisoning. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the move \u201ca deliberate unfriendly step towards Russia\u201d and said that the EU \u201cinflicted damage\u201d on the bloc\u2019s relations with Russia.  \u201cMoscow will analyze the situation and will act in accordance with its own interests,\u201d Peskov said, adding that \u201cno logic can be seen in such a decision\u201d by the EU. EU foreign ministers agreed Monday to impose the sanctions under sanctions to combat the use and spread of chemical weapons, following a push by France and Germany. The legal procedures were completed Thursday.  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the EU had acted \u201cwith exceptional speed, in keeping with the seriousness of this act and the methods used.\u201d  \u201cThis demonstrates a European Union that acts in the face of the new, unacceptable and destabilizing use of a chemical weapon,\u201d he said at a meeting in Paris. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has suggested that Moscow might retaliate and even sever ties over the Navalny dispute. \u201cThe Germans are not planning to provide any facts, despite all international and legal obligations. We respond in kind. This is diplomatic practice,\u201d he said Wednesday. A day earlier, Lavrov had said: \u201cwe probably simply have to temporarily stop talking to those people in the West who are responsible for foreign policy and don\u2019t understand the need for mutually respectful dialogue.\u201d In a phone call Tuesday with Lavrov, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell insisted that the EU \u201cwishes to maintain open channels of communication with Russia and to enhance cooperation on issues of mutual interest,\u201d according to a statement from Borrell\u2019s office. Borrell also underlined that Moscow \u201cmust do its utmost to investigate this crime thoroughly in full transparency and to fully cooperate\u201d with the OPCW. He said the EU \u201cwill continue to defend its interests and values, including respect for international law and fundamental rights.\u201d Daria Litvinova in Moscow, Geir Moulson in Berlin, and Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.

{"text": "If you enjoyed reading this, subscribe for more! Many observers predicted that the coronavirus pandemic might lead Russian President Vladimir Putin to rethink his highly opportunistic, zero-sum approach to foreign policy. Such assessments turned out to be little more than exercises in wishful thinking. If anything, the Kremlin\u2019s policy toward \u201ccore Europe\u201d\u2014Germany, France, and the United Kingdom\u2014has followed the same aggressive, in-your-face approach, leading to growing awareness that Moscow is not at all serious about lowering the tensions that followed the annexation of Crimea and war in eastern Ukraine. Today, Russia\u2019s relations with core Europe are getting worse. The Kremlin taunts the West over the attempted assassination of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny using a banned military-grade nerve agent. Its suggestions that he was somehow poisoned in Germany, where he was flown for treatment, have pulled the rug out from under longtime advocates of closer cooperation in the economic and energy sphere, including Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel. A controversial attempt by French President Emmanuel Macron to re-engage the Kremlin on a range of strategic and regional issues is also now at risk. The United Kingdom continues to try to push back against Russian malign activities on its territory and to limit undue influence, but a light-touch approach to regulation has made it difficult to achieve major breakthroughs. Why does the Kremlin pursue policies toward Europe that appear so counterproductive on their face? Instead of carefully seeking to exploit long-standing differences within NATO and the European Union about the proper response to Russian aggression against Ukraine or interference in the affairs of European nations, it is Moscow\u2019s own overreach and missteps that time and again encourage greater Western unity, or at the very least leave the allies no alternative to confronting Russia. That pattern, in turn, fosters a dynamic that only makes the Kremlin feel more insecure over the long term. A contributing factor is Moscow\u2019s perennial attempts\u2014unacceptable in twenty-first-century Europe\u2014to treat Germany, France, and the United Kingdom as members of a nineteenth-century-style steering committee of great powers who are entitled somehow to decide the fate of the entire Continent on their own. The Kremlin\u2019s approach to Europe highlights its failure to appreciate the importance of the European project for Berlin and Paris. Russian officials appear to believe their own propaganda that the West has entered a period of irreversible decline and division and all they need to do to succeed as a great power is wait out their many adversaries. The Kremlin\u2019s actions point to a major fault in its strategy toward Europe. Its efforts to deepen and capitalize on what in reality are long-standing differences between the leaders of core Europe and Washington are likely to prove shortsighted and backfire. Germany\u2019s dual track approach of maintaining strong transatlantic security ties with other forms of close engagement with Moscow has been a key feature of its foreign policy since the 1960s. Likewise, Macron is following in the footsteps of previous leaders like former French president Charles de Gaulle in advocating for a new level of dialogue and d\u00e9tente with the Kremlin. But would a more splintered European order, hastened by the corrosive effects of Russia\u2019s policies\u2014without a strong, yet pragmatic, unifying leader like Angela Merkel, who is nearing the end of her tenure\u2014actually be better for Russian interests? During the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic, there were short-lived hopes that the scale of the crisis might prompt a rethink on the part of Russian President Vladimir Putin of his assertive brand of foreign policy. With much of the global economy at a standstill and oil prices in free fall, many observers suggested that he would be forced to shift his attentions to problems closer to home. Surely, cooler heads in the Kremlin would recognize that Russia\u2019s ongoing campaign of mayhem and malign activities in the West\u2014along with more quixotic adventures further afield in parts of the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America\u2014was becoming counterproductive or simply unaffordable. Yet throughout the crisis the Putin regime has never wavered on its core agenda. The threat of a dramatic drop in oil revenues for the Russian state budget was minimized following an emergency agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on production cuts that helped stabilize the oil market. The government\u2019s capable economic team decided once again that it was preferable for average citizens to bear the brunt of the adjustment caused by the crisis rather than dip deeply into the country\u2019s hard-currency reserves, which total nearly $600 billion.  Thanks to a weaker ruble, higher government spending, and increased domestic borrowing, the Kremlin has managed to avoid explosive growth in the unemployment rate, to mount a modest public-health response to the pandemic, and to avoid draconian cuts in defense and national security expenditures. The political bill for Putin\u2019s aloof handling of the crisis was also delayed, even though his popularity has experienced significant declines. Even before the virus, policymakers in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom (the site of a Russian-state-sponsored attack using a military-grade nerve agent in 2018) had harbored hopes of lowering the temperature with Russia. For these countries, which will be referred to in this paper as core Europe, the pandemic was initially seen as a potential opportunity to break out of the downward spiral created by the Ukraine crisis in 2014. They have thus been caught off-guard by the sharp deterioration of relations that began in August following the disputed election outcome in Belarus and the attempted assassination of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. This paper seeks to assess why Russian policies and behavior toward core Europe have hardened during the pandemic. Rather than dealing with major challenges at home or building bridges to former partners, the Kremlin has instead pursued policies that prioritize short-term advantage over the prospect of re-normalization. The stances of Germany and France on Russia have been widely criticized in recent years\u2014for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s defense of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline and French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s attempt to launch a strategic dialogue with Putin\u2014but in the end it is largely the Kremlin\u2019s behavior that has aggravated relations. Nonetheless, there is value in forming a judgment about the extent to which current European approaches have conformed to or strayed from long-standing patterns. For example, Germany\u2019s leaders have long pursued a dual-track policy of constraining Russia\u2019s foreign policy ambitions and maintaining a strong stake in transatlantic security ties while trying to foster various types of economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. In a similar vein, there are clear parallels between Macron\u2019s efforts and former president Charles de Gaulle\u2019s outreach to the Soviet leadership at the height of the Cold War. And, while the United Kingdom has witnessed the sharpest deterioration in its relationship with Russia, its political economy creates unusual entr\u00e9e for state-backed and nonstate Russian actors in myriad ways, some of which are potentially quite harmful to its national security. The Kremlin has long preferred to deal with individual European countries rather than the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the European Union (EU). It has treated core Europe very much in the tradition of nineteenth century great-power diplomacy or as the European politburo. This approach is partly utilitarian and partly based on awareness that European leaders see value in maintaining direct lines of communication with Moscow and do not always see eye to eye with Washington. At the same time, the Kremlin has frequently overestimated the quality of the cards it has to play in Europe. Repeated Russian attempts to split NATO or the EU have fallen flat over the past several decades. The staying power of both institutions\u2014and the European unity that undergirds them\u2014has been quite impressive, even in extreme circumstances like the current pandemic, the annexation of Crimea and war in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the Euromissile crisis of the early 1980s. Along the way, Russian leaders have demonstrated a repeated propensity to shoot themselves in the foot. Their overreach has stiffened European resolve and reinforced the central role of Germany, which precisely because of its special relationship with Russia has been crucial in managing the EU\u2019s ties with a truculent neighbor. Moscow has also demonstrated time and again that it simply does not get the importance of the EU for Germany and France, and that lack of understanding frequently backfires for the Kremlin. For their part, U.S. diplomats and military officers have long strived to reconcile the competing priorities and goals of their European allies. As one very experienced NATO hand put it, the leaders of the alliance have generally proved themselves to be masters at balancing conventional and nuclear defense, balancing d\u00e9tente and defense, balancing the process of European integration which de Gaulle wanted with alliance of the Atlantic solidarity, balancing national interests, which are very strong, with the need for a common denominator of collective security. With Russian behavior once again posing a direct threat to NATO members, this balancing act has become increasingly important of late, but the alliance has generally succeeded in restoring a proper level of focus to its original core mission of deterrence and collective defense. The United States has traditionally relied on high-level diplomacy and informal decisionmaking and coordination mechanisms to help shape transatlantic policy toward Russia and to bridge differences with its core European allies. During former U.S. president Gerald Ford\u2019s administration, the Quad was created to facilitate regular dialogue among the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom at the level of foreign ministers and senior diplomats. More recently, this mechanism has played an important role in the response to Russia\u2019s military aggression against Ukraine, including joint U.S./EU economic sanctions, the revitalization of NATO, and steps to improve the resilience of EU and frontline countries to respond to Russian malign activities. There have long been subtle yet significant differences in the approaches pursued by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom toward Russia. For example, on the Ukraine crisis Merkel took the lead within the EU on forging a unified stance with then U.S. president Barack Obama\u2019s administration, using her personal political capital to shape and sustain the sanctions regime while carving out a diplomatic track on the basis of the Minsk accords. At the same time, she has never abandoned close engagement with Russia on energy, trade, and commercial matters, which has frequently ruffled feathers in Washington as well as in Central European capitals. By contrast, the United Kingdom\u2019s policy and rhetoric on Russia have traditionally been much firmer than Germany\u2019s or France\u2019s. In a dramatic speech in November 2017, the UK\u2019s then prime minister Theresa May portrayed the Kremlin as a threat to the international order, citing the war in Ukraine, election meddling, a \u201csustained campaign of cyber espionage and disruption,\u201d and the weaponizing of information. \u201cI have a very simple message for Russia,\u201d May said. \u201cWe know what you are doing. And you will not succeed.\u201d  Yet during this contentious period her eventual successor, Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, nurtured hopes for a possible reset in relations.  Even today some pockets of the foreign policy establishment remain open to turning the page with Russia. It is hard to imagine such an effort succeeding, however, given how the Novichok attack on former Soviet intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury in March 2018 has transformed the domestic political context. Still, as Duncan Allan, a longtime Foreign and Commonwealth Office Russia specialist, has written, The measures adopted after the Salisbury attack were essentially a sterner version of what was tried in 2007 [following the killing in the United Kingdom of former Russian intelligence officer Aleksandr Litvinenko with radioactive polonium]\u2013 broadly \u2018deterrence by denial\u2019 (making it more difficult to conduct future hostile attacks on UK soil). There was minimal resort to \u2018deterrence by punishment\u2019 (i.e., imposing a cost to discourage future unacceptable activities) beyond symbolic steps such as suspending high-level bilateral contacts and not sending ministers or members of the royal family to the World Cup. A report of the UK parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee published in July 2020\u2014 after a lengthy, politically inspired delay\u2014provides a similarly withering assessment of the government\u2019s handling of the growing Russian threat. It details the absence of adequate responses to an array of hostile activities by Moscow, including suspected meddling in the Brexit referendum, cyber and information operations, and the reported killings of more than a dozen opponents of the Putin regime on British soil.  The report also chronicles the struggles of British law enforcement and security authorities to curb Russian influence in the country and prevent inflows of illicit finance. As for France, Macron\u2019s approach, with its unabashed boldness and risk-taking as well as pointed criticism of the past handling of the Kremlin by the country\u2019s \u201cdeep state,\u201d  has been the outlier among the core Europe countries. In an August 2019 address delivered on the eve of a summit meeting with Putin, Macron asserted that it was unacceptable for the relationship with Russia to stay frozen. Doing so placed the EU in the middle of a \u201cstrategic battle between the United States and Russia.\u201d  Following in the footsteps of de Gaulle, who advocated d\u00e9tente and rapprochement with the Kremlin in the mid-1960s, Macron announced that the time had arrived for a strategic dialogue to build \u201can agenda of trust.\u201d The provocative analysis and strategic thinking outlined in Macron\u2019s address were overshadowed by a conspicuous lack of diplomatic finesse that ignored the deep divisions on Russia that have plagued the EU for years. Presenting such views without advance consultation with key countries like Germany was counterproductive. Macron exacerbated intra-EU tensions by asserting that some frontline EU/NATO countries were happy with the status quo and supported additional sanctions because they were not interested in the situation ever improving. Macron\u2019s critics said he was offering concessions to the Kremlin ahead of any changes in behavior and trying to foreclose the possibility of future EU or NATO membership for countries like Ukraine and Georgia. Undaunted, Macron\u2019s government has pursued a series of high-level interactions with Russia, led by a longtime French career diplomat (and fellow Carnegie Endowment for International Peace scholar), Pierre Vimont, and Putin\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, Yuriy Ushakov. These talks have included exchanges involving foreign and defense ministers, top military commanders, and the intelligence services. The dialogue has covered issues such as arms control and disarmament, regional hot spots, cyber activities and new threats, and the deconfliction of military activities and confidence-building measures. French officials insist that they never expected the relationship would be transformed in short order, but Russian officials have reportedly shown no flexibility in the ongoing discussions. The Kremlin is all too aware that Macron is not in a position to negotiate on behalf of the EU, let alone the United States. As former French ambassador to Russia Jean-Maurice Ripert put it, the Russians need to regain some form of economic and political legitimacy, because their only way of existing for the past ten years has been through military action. But that requires major bilateral negotiations. The Russians do not want to negotiate security in Europe with us, but with the Americans. As of July 2020, Macron\u2019s initiative had not produced any concrete signs of progress, according to Defense Minister Florence Parly. At the same time, trends in public opinion also impose certain constraints on policymaking in the countries of core Europe. On the whole, a lack of trust in Putin and wariness about Russia are easily discernible in public perceptions in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.  (See figures 1 and 2.) Yet the level of public concern about the threat posed by Russia is fairly subdued in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Only 33 percent of Germans and 40 percent of French surveyed said Russia was a threat to security in Europe, according to a 2018 poll.  By contrast, 50 percent of Germans and 44 percent of French respondents in the same poll said they see the United States as the main threat to European security.  In 2017, only 8 percent of German respondents in one poll identified Russia as the country\u2019s greatest foreign policy challenge.  In the United Kingdom, 33 percent of respondents in a 2020 poll said they viewed Russian military power as a major threat to national security. As discussed above, the coronavirus pandemic has not triggered significant deviations from the Kremlin\u2019s full-contact, highly opportunistic approach to foreign policy. Rather, the foreign policy apparatus continues to operate in familiar ways on issues close to home and much further afield. This continuity reflects several factors, including the Russian leadership\u2019s well-established view that entertaining, let alone implementing, meaningful policy changes on a given issue will inevitably be perceived as a sign of weakness and an invitation to foreign powers to increase their demands. Over the past fifteen years, the Kremlin has repeatedly demonstrated that it understands three things very well: how to build and exploit leverage, how to create facts on the ground, and how to identify and capitalize on the weaknesses of and vacuums created by Russia\u2019s adversaries. The latest flashpoints in Europe\u2019s relationship with Russia\u2014the crisis in Belarus and the attack on Navalny\u2014illustrate the challenge facing Western leaders. Germany, France, and other European countries have repeatedly tried to help defuse the dangerous standoff in Belarus between Alexander Lukashenko and the protest movement, but they have very little leverage, for example, to insist on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as the main platform for dialogue. Putin has repeatedly waved off such suggestions, signaling instead his willingness to intervene militarily if necessary. In the meantime, the Kremlin has spread disinformation about foreign meddling in Belarus, portraying the protests and Western diplomatic outreach as part of an effort to stage a color revolution. In August Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: I urge all the people saying that mediation is the only way out of the current situation to not forget how our Western colleagues \u2018mediated\u2019 in 2014 during the Maidan in Kiev. Back then, esteemed representatives of the European Union \u2018mediated\u2019 and reached agreements, but we all remember what it turned into. In a similar vein, the Kremlin has dismissed Western concerns about Navalny, who was poisoned on Russian soil and evacuated to Germany for medical treatment. Instead of taking German, French, and Swedish toxicology reports seriously and mounting a credible investigation, Russian officials are sticking to the established playbook from the earlier attack on Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom. Russian officials and proxies engage in over-the-top denialism and disinformation about the use of Novichok in the attack, demanding that Western counterparts share any hard evidence of traces of this banned substance and spreading endless numbers of alternative theories and explanations to muddy the waters. Senior figures such as Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Director Sergey Naryshkin and Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin have made preposterous claims that Western intelligence agencies may have staged the attack as a provocation. What emerges from recent interviews with senior European diplomats is the unmistakable sense that dialogue with Moscow remains almost completely nonproductive and that discussions on the most important issues on the European-Russian agenda have all been moving in the wrong direction. The Normandy process on ending the war in Ukraine has been slowly unraveling following the January 2020 appointment of a new Russian representative, Dmitri Kozak.  His antics have largely paralyzed that process, upending initial expectations that he might emerge as a more constructive interlocutor than his predecessor, former Kremlin political guru Vladislav Surkov. Ongoing attempts to engage the Kremlin about the corrosive impact on relations with core Europe of malign activities such as cyber operations, targeted killings, and the deployment of Russian mercenaries in Libya and other regional conflicts have been met by flat denials, stonewalling and pro forma, tit-for-tat counteraccusations. For Germany, other salient issues on the bilateral agenda include the 2015 hacking of the Bundestag (discussed below) and the 2019 murder of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a critic of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and former militant, in broad daylight in central Berlin. When Foreign Minister Heiko Maas visited Moscow in August 2020, he made no headway on either issue. In recent years the United Kingdom has led coordinated efforts to expose Russian cyber activities. UK authorities formally attributed to Russia cyber operations targeting Ukraine, Georgia, and research institutions involved in coronavirus vaccine development in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. (The Russian government has disavowed any responsibility. ) While the United Kingdom\u2019s public moves have presumably been accompanied by other undisclosed activities to raise the costs of Russian behavior, there is as yet no indication that formal attribution of attacks involving Russian-government-sponsored hackers APT28 (the group also known as Fancy Bear, which has been linked to Russia\u2019s military intelligence service, the GRU ) and APT29 (the SVR-linked group also known as Cozy Bear ) is producing changes in Russian behavior. More recently the UK government has publicized Russian interference in the December 2019 general election via a hack-and-release effort involving sensitive U.S.-UK trade documents reportedly stolen from the personal email account of then trade minister Liam Fox. According to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, the documents were \u201cdisseminated online via the social media platform Reddit. When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the General Election.\u201d  Jeremy Corbyn, then leader of the UK Labor Party, sought to capitalize on the documents in the final weeks of the election campaign. \u201cThis is not only a plot against our NHS [National Health Service],\u201d said Corbyn in late November 2019. \u201cIt is a plot against the whole country.\u201d It has not been alleged that Corbyn was aware of the source of the documents. Russia\u2019s recent track record leaves an inescapable impression that the Kremlin is profoundly uninterested in forging any improvement in relations with core Europe. Instead, Russian policy is following well-established priorities that have been such a constant in recent years as to almost seem immutable. These are: At the same time, the Kremlin\u2019s approach to core Europe appears to be relying on a latter day equivalent of the Roman-era Fabian strategy of fighting a war of attrition rather than frontal assault. Put simply, the Putin regime hopes to prevail in a test of wills with Europe (and, by extension, the United States) just by not losing and outlasting its many adversaries. Moreover, Russian officials often act in high-handed ways that suggest they actually believe the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda that says the Western camp is in inexorable decline and that many of its cherished values and ideas are discredited or have been disowned by public opinion. Such attitudes help explain why there has been so much opportunism and continuity in Russian behavior throughout the coronavirus pandemic.  In March, a leaked EU report highlighted an ongoing Russian disinformation campaign intended \u201cto aggravate the public health crisis in western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems \u2014 thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak.\u201d  Within days, the Russian military launched a series of aid deliveries and troop deployments to northern Italy, Serbia, and Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The deliveries aimed to discredit the EU\u2019s accusations and to shine a spotlight on a string of embarrassing everyone-for-himself policy failures by EU member states.  Macron and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell responded frostily to the Kremlin\u2019s moves, with the latter decrying a \u201cstruggle for influence through spinning and the \u2018politics of generosity\u2019.\u201d  The launch of the Sputnik-V vaccine in August 2020 (in advance of clinical trials) has confirmed Moscow\u2019s continued preference for public-relations stunts that play on raw emotions instead of practical contributions to fighting the pandemic. The combined effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Belarus crisis, and the Navalny attack have upended Germany\u2019s political landscape in ways that are bound to limit Russian influence. Merkel\u2019s personal popularity has soared to all-time highs while the fortunes of populist political parties like the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) have ebbed significantly.  Although the AfD and Die Linke (the Left) remain resolutely pro-Russian voices in the political debate, they have had practically zero impact on policymaking before and during the pandemic. The May 2020 indictment in absentia of the GRU hacker responsible for the 2015 Bundestag attack and the upcoming trial of the suspected assassin of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili provide vivid illustrations of how Russian malign activities are touching closer to the heart of German politics and society. The government has tried to handle both cases carefully to limit the impact on other parts of the relationship with Moscow and to allow the legal process to play out.That balancing act has become more difficult as details about ties between Khangoshvili\u2019s alleged killer, Vadim Krasikov, and the Russian state have become clearer.  According to the indictment, \u201cState agencies of the central government of the Russian Federation commissioned the defendant to liquidate the Georgian citizen of Chechen origin.\u201d  The fact that Putin expressed his delight at Khangoshvili\u2019s murder has not made the German government\u2019s life easier.  With the trial likely to bring new details to light, the government will face greater pressure to go beyond the largely symbolic expulsion of two intelligence officers from the Russian embassy in Berlin in December 2019. In the meantime, the case of Dmitri Badin, the GRU hacker held responsible for the Bundestag hack, has slowly wound its way through the German legal system. (Badin was previously indicted by U.S. law-enforcement authorities for his role in attacks on the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and the World Anti-Doping Agency in 2014\u20132018.) Following his indictment, Berlin orchestrated the first-ever use of a new EU sanctions mechanism targeting individuals and institutions involved in cyber attacks.  During his August 2020 Moscow visit, Maas portrayed the sanctions as \u201ca first shot across the bows of those who believe they can inflict damage in cyberspace with impunity.\u201d  In response, Lavrov issued flimsy counterclaims about the purported failure of German authorities to address official complaints about cyber intrusions against Russian government institutions from Germany-based IP addresses. Moscow is also likely on the losing end of a possible generational realignment of Russia policy in conjunction with Merkel\u2019s expected departure and the general election in the autumn of 2021. That prospect is already causing disquiet in Russian government circles, reflecting the Kremlin\u2019s traditional aversion to the uncertainty of Western leadership transitions and preference for dealing with known quantities. Current trends suggest the emergence of a new governing coalition consisting of the Christian Democrats and the Greens, who have regularly staked out a far tougher line on Russia than Merkel\u2019s current coalition partners, the Social Democrats. Green Party co-leader Annalena Baerbock has laid the blame directly on the Kremlin for the Navalny poisoning and called for an end to business as usual with Russia, the cancelation of Nord Stream 2, and the imposition of sanctions and asset freezes against top Russian business figures active in Germany. The leadership of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) continues to be riven by an unresolved debate about how best to balance the traditional German focus on trade and commercial cooperation with the need to show Russia that its unacceptable behavior has consequences. That split is visible in the conflicting positions staked out by the top contenders to succeed Merkel. Bavarian premier Markus S\u00f6der (who leads the CDU\u2019s sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union) and North Rhine-Westphalia premier Armin Laschet have aligned themselves with Merkel\u2019s position that the project is a purely private-sector initiative that should be decoupled from foreign policy issues like the Navalny attack. Veteran Christian Democrats Friedrich Merz and Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Norbert R\u00f6ttgen\u2014both, along with Laschet, candidates to succeed Merkel as party chief in December\u2014have called for it to be frozen. Advocates of business interests and proponents of the traditional   formula of \u201cchange by rapprochement\u201d ( ) have been increasingly on the defensive. Their hand has been weakened by the fact that Russian-German trade appears to have peaked following the imposition of EU sanctions in 2014; turnover in 2019 was \u20ac54.5 billion, down by roughly 30 percent since 2012.  More recently, bilateral trade fell by nearly 25 percent during the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. In the second quarter of 2020, new German foreign direct investment in Russia hit its lowest level since 2000. Strong countervailing pressure comes from Germany\u2019s energy policy, which is being transformed by a combination of ambitious climate targets and shifting domestic priorities yet also risks tying the country much closer to Russia. Ahead of a planned phasing out of nuclear power by the end of 2022 and of coal by 2038, Germany is seeking to ramp up very quickly the role of renewables in electricity generation and to become an important hub for the trade and distribution of natural gas. However, the country is almost completely dependent on foreign sources of natural gas, which now account for 93 percent of supply. The share of Russian gas in Germany\u2019s imports has increased significantly in recent years and now stands at 57 percent. That growth, which is partially a by-product of the planned phasing out of the Groningen field in the Netherlands by the end of 2022, is in marked contrast to the overall trend throughout the EU. Russia accounted for only 38.3 percent of the EU\u2019s natural gas imports in 2018.  Critics worry that completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline could lock in this structural dependence for years if not decades to come. At the same time, a global natural-gas supply glut and volatile European prices make it difficult to have high confidence about future German gas consumption levels. There is also growing concern among German law enforcement and national security officials about the increased popularity of homegrown fringe political figures who spread disinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic. Russia is contributing in non-negligible ways to this phenomenon, which benefits from savvy use of online platforms such as YouTube and Telegram. Leading grassroots figures involved in the protests against pandemic health-related restrictions receive frequent attention from Russian-state-controlled media outlets such as RT Deutsch and Sputnik Deutschland as well as Russia-aligned anti-establishment media outlets such as   Security officials, including the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency (BfV), have also warned repeatedly that right-wing extremists and neo-Nazi groups are seeking to commandeer the protest movement for their own purposes.  Members of some of these extremist groups have received military training in Russia, including at a facility run by the Russian Imperial Movement, which was designated a global terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in April 2020.  The rapid growth of conspiracy-theory groups benefits from loopholes in legislation and regulations aimed at preventing hate speech and political extremism.  As already shown in the notorious \u201cLisa\u201d case in 2016 during the height of the migration crisis, Russia-tied actors are highly opportunistic, operating mainly in plain sight of the authorities. Macron has frequently turned himself into a lightning rod thanks to his knack for provocative statements, such as proclaiming the brain death of NATO, that challenge or criticize policy orthodoxy. His stance on Russia has generally followed this pattern. Macron\u2019s initiative to launch a strategic dialogue with Putin was partially borne of frustration with what he perceived as policy gridlock within EU institutions. In early 2016 EU leaders agreed on five guiding principles that called for full implementation of the Minsk agreements as a prerequisite for any improvement in relations, stronger ties to Russia\u2019s neighbors, stronger EU internal resilience in areas such as energy security and hybrid threats, selective engagement with Russia on major policy issues where there is a clear EU interest, and increased support for Russian civil society and people-to-people contacts.  In his August 2019 speech, Macron essentially argued that the divisions within the EU were rendering institutions such as the European External Access Service far less effective even as Russia has remained extremely active in various parts of the world, often at Europe\u2019s expense. [Russia] has gained room for maneuver thanks to our weaknesses. In the past five years, Russia has played an unprecedented role in every major conflict; it has played an unprecedented role because the United States of America, Britain and France have been weak. We set red lines, they were crossed and we did not take action. They understood this very well, they advanced. . . . In the current situation, Russia has maximized all its interests: it has returned to Syria, it has returned to Libya, it has returned to Africa, it is present in every crisis because of our weaknesses or mistakes. Macron\u2019s attempt to forge a new strategic dialogue with Russia is quite similar to the approaches pursued by his predecessors. It also is informed by the outlook of conservative French political elites, who have never been shy about their anti-Americanism, desire for autonomy from transatlantic structures, and generally friendly attitude toward Moscow.  Macron\u2019s advisers also emphasize that Western policies have not produced a change in Russian behavior and that the status quo is unacceptable. In the words of former foreign minister Hubert V\u00e9drine, who serves as an informal sounding board for Macron, It\u2019s not about loving the Russian regime or Putin, or stopping our calls for the Russians to become more \u2018democratic,\u2019 but to know what kind of relations we want to have with this great neighboring country, and if it is up to the United States alone to redefine this relationship. Meanwhile, the existence of multiple pathways for Russian influence in French political and corporate circles tends not to set off alarm bells in Paris. Issues such as terrorism, China, and the challenging relationship with the United States are widely seen as France\u2019s most pressing foreign policy priorities, which means in practice that Russia simply does not preoccupy French leaders or the political class the way it does those in Berlin, London, or Washington.  However, while Macron and other senior members of his team have on occasion made skeptical noises about EU sanctions against Russia, they have not tried to block their regular renewal out of deference to Merkel. French-Russian trade ties have been largely stagnant for the past several years and are only one-fourth the size of the bilateral trade relationship between Russia and Germany. The trade and commercial relationship was fairly limited even before the coronavirus pandemic due to Russia\u2019s extended economic doldrums and the ruble devaluation that accompanied a sharp decline in energy prices in 2014. Since 2010, total trade turnover has declined by nearly one-third, and it was roughly \u20ac13.8 billion in 2019. Russia was France\u2019s eleventh-largest trading partner in 2018; by comparison, trade volume with China was more than four times greater. Russia\u2019s involvement in French politics has remained fairly subdued throughout the pandemic. Russian-sponsored disinformation and propaganda efforts aimed at the French public have been limited. That stands in marked contrast to the huge political outcry caused by a false posting about the French government\u2019s handling of the pandemic that appeared on the website of the Chinese embassy.  During earlier periods Russia\u2019s political leaders, state propaganda apparatus, and proxies have left much more conspicuous fingerprints. For example, in 2017 a murky alliance of Russia-based hackers and U.S. alt-right activist hackers interfered in the presidential election by releasing emails stolen from Macron\u2019s campaign on the eve of the second round of voting. Russian state-controlled media also spread rumors in an attempt to damage Macron\u2019s candidacy.  And in 2018\u20132019 Russia-connected media outlets frequently amplified the disruptive protests of the Yellow Vests movement. The Russian government has long-standing ties to French far-right politicians. Six weeks before the 2017 election, Putin met in the Kremlin with Marine Le Pen, Macron\u2019s challenger and longtime leader of the National Rally (formerly National Front.) The cash-strapped party also received a \u20ac9.4 million loan from a shadowy Russian bank in 2014. More recently, the National Rally has continued with its well-established cheerleading for the Kremlin\u2019s actions. For example, a large delegation of its members in the European Parliament visited Moscow and Crimea in July 2020 to observe the referendum on extending Putin\u2019s time in office. (Far-right politicians from Germany, Italy, and other countries made similar pilgrimages. At Macron\u2019s first meeting with Putin in 2017, he chided the Russian leader over the Kremlin\u2019s blatant interference in the election. \u201cThe situation was so serious because during the democratic campaign some so-called media outlets interfered, acting under the influence of certain political interests,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIn other words, Russia Today and Sputnik did not behave as the press or as journalists should. They behaved like bodies of influence, bodies of propaganda, that is, bodies of false propaganda, no more and no less.\u201d Macron has pressed for a credible Russian investigation of the assassination attempt on Navalny, aligning himself closely with Germany and postponing the next round of so-called two-plus-two talks between the French and Russian ministers of foreign affairs and defense. The Kremlin\u2019s allies in the National Rally have prioritized trying to shield Moscow from foreign pressure, warning against any rush to judgment. For example, Thierry Mariani, a member of the European Parliament and former minister, tweeted \u201cWho can prove the Russian government\u2019s involvement in the poisoning of #Navalny? No one! Stop accusations without proof! Those nostalgic for the East/West confrontation are ready to exploit all the dramas to a new cold war.\u201d One area where France\u2019s preoccupation with counterterrorism has aligned with Russian interests is in Libya. Since the mid-2010s, the two countries have been de facto allies, thanks to their clandestine support of General Khalifa Haftar, the leader of the Libyan National Army, though both have also engaged with and supported the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), which Haftar opposes. Along with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, France and Russia have supplied Haftar\u2019s forces with weapons, military advisers, and other material in violation of a United Nations (UN) arms embargo.  While providing lip service and formal recognition to the GNA, France has justified its actions as part of the fight against terrorist and criminal groups operating in Libya and Chad, though an undercurrent of ideological affinity, including anti-Islamism and a pro-strongman bent that is evident in France\u2019s broader Africa policies, also cements this partnership. At the same time, increased Russian adventurism in Africa is generating considerable irritation and mistrust in Paris. In 2017\u20132018 France\u2019s leadership was blindsided by what it described as \u201cpredatory\u201d Kremlin maneuvers in the region, including anti-French information operations and the deployment of mercenaries from the Wagner Group to the Central African Republic, a former French colony. Since then Russia has effectively replaced France as the country\u2019s chief security partner. The French government sees the Central African Republic as an important test case of the Kremlin\u2019s intentions. In the words of Chief of the Defense Staff General Francois Lecointre, the country is a \u201claboratory to test the goodwill proclaimed by Russia to be a partner in the resolution of crises, and not [a power] that wants to use these crises for the purposes of destabilization.\u201d While the intensity of anti-French influence operations in the Central African Republic has declined somewhat in recent months, the Kremlin is increasingly stoking anti-French sentiment in West Africa, which is generating considerable high-level concern. The fight against terrorism in the Sahel has been a priority area in recent years for Paris, which has dispatched some 5,100 troops to the region.  Macron has complained publicly that foreign powers are trying to push European countries out of the region \u201cbecause they have their own agenda, an agenda of mercenaries.\u201d Russia has sold modest amounts of military equipment and provided limited opportunities for joint military training across the region in recent years, but it has not created a large-scale footprint there. Nor are there concrete indications that the Kremlin is actively trying to supplant France\u2019s leadership of the multinational anti-terrorism mission in the Sahel. Rather, it appears that stoking instability and causing trouble for France are simply ends in themselves. The Kremlin\u2019s preferred means in the Sahel include old-fashioned cultivation of regional officials and low-cost tools such as inauthentic social-media campaigns. Materials created by the Russian Internet Research Agency that Facebook took down in August 2020 included an example of a Mali-related, anti-French posting in Arabic (see figure 3).  Traces of pro-Russia influence operations, disinformation, and propaganda about the security situation in the region are relatively easy to find on social media. For example, social-media posts disseminated images of the Russian flag and pro-Putin signs that featured prominently in celebrations in Bamako following the military coup in August 2020.  Facebook posts at the time also spread fake claims that Russian troops had landed in Mali in the aftermath of the coup (see figure 4).  Meanwhile, a group calling itself the \u201cGroupe des Patriotes du Mali\u201d posts a steady stream of harsh anti-French and pro-Russian materials on Facebook (see figure 5). To be sure, France\u2019s operations in the Sahel face considerable challenges that have little to do with any problems generated by Russia. These include mounting public anger over civilian casualties, governance and partner capacity shortcomings, and the possible scaling back of U.S. contributions such as strategic airlift and intelligence support. At the same time, it is clear that Russian mischief in the region is not a peripheral concern for Paris, which has seized on it as one of the criteria for whether it can restore trust to the bilateral relationship. Whether or not they are part of a well-coordinated and strategic approach, Moscow\u2019s actions in the Sahel are having a corrosive effect on relations with the Macron government. Pathways for Russian influence in the United Kingdom have become an increasingly prominent topic in recent years. Although it is widely assumed that relations were spoiled by the war in Ukraine and the Skripal attack, the roots of the current antagonism go deeper. Former prime minister Tony Blair was the first prominent Western leader to court Putin during his early years in power. The culminating moment came in 2003 when Blair and Putin personally oversaw the launch of a major energy joint venture, TNK-BP. The result of an arranged marriage between a Western oil major and a top Russian company, TNK-BP was hailed as the largest single foreign direct investment in the Russian economy at the time.  Yet the burgeoning relationship was disrupted months later when British courts granted political asylum to Boris Berezovsky, a political nemesis of Putin\u2019s, and to a prominent Chechen separatist.  Putin regarded these decisions as an act of personal betrayal, and his relationships with UK counterparts never recovered. Russian officials have long made clear in private that the Kremlin does not view the United Kingdom as a great power but as a country that largely implements the will of the United States. Yet events in recent years have shown that the United Kingdom is, in fact, capable of exerting significant influence over the policies of its allies and partners. In the most widely publicized example, creative UK diplomacy after the Skripal attack led to the coordinated expulsions of dozens of Russian intelligence personnel from more than twenty countries. UK law enforcement, intelligence and strategic communications officials also worked aggressively to turn the tables on the GRU, exposing it to outright ridicule for the botched attack. The United Kingdom\u2019s considerable capabilities in the cyber domain have been marshaled for similar purposes in the hope of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to operate with impunity. UK specialists have also worked behind the scenes to strengthen the resilience of frontline countries and others in Russia\u2019s neighborhood, helping them to combat disinformation and other types of malign activities. At the same time, the UK authorities have made little headway in constraining Russian malign activities conducted inside the country, let alone establishing a proper level of oversight of the extensive Russian presence there. For decades, the Russian elite has had nearly wide-open access to the UK\u2019s economy and to key players in elite political and business circles. Prominent members of the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have been widely criticized for their chummy relationships with prominent well-to-do Russians, many of whom have connections to the Russian government.  These ties run the gamut from glamorous social connections to more problematic activities such as political fund-raising and lucrative business relationships.  The ISC report states: \u201cIt is notable that a number of Members of the House of Lords have business interests linked to Russia, or work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state.\u201d As discussed above, the extensive presence of wealthy Russian business figures and corporate interests throughout the United Kingdom is a feature, not a bug, of the country\u2019s light-touch regulatory framework. The British leadership has long actively sought to promote the United Kingdom as a global financial and business center yet failed to anticipate the harmful second-order effects on the country\u2019s governance, sovereignty, and national security. For more than a quarter-century, the government has put out a welcome mat for Russian and other wealthy foreign nationals, providing preferential access to visas in return for relatively small investments of 2 million pounds. Today Russian money and corporate interests are a major factor across the breadth of the British business world, the energy sector, the financial services industry, and the high-end real estate market. This presence also helps support an industry of so-called enablers who provide legal, consulting, accountancy, security, and other services to Russian high-net-worth individuals, families, and corporations. Despite the imposition of blocking sanctions on high-level Kremlin-tied figures in 2014\u20132015, there are indications Putin associates like Arkadiy Rotenberg have managed to move significant amounts of money through UK-based financial institutions. As documented in the 2020 report by the parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), officials have often talked big about creating arsenals of legal, diplomatic, and law-enforcement tools to make the United Kingdom a less hospitable jurisdiction for unsavory or illicit Russian interests. Such tools were rolled out with great fanfare after the Skripal attack. Yet the United Kingdom has struggled, for example, to launch a public registry of beneficial-ownership information that would provide transparency about who actually stands behind a vast array of foreign-owned real estate and corporate vehicles. Another much-touted measure, unexplained wealth orders, has been far less useful than UK officials originally suggested. They were devised to allow UK law enforcement to investigate how \u2018politically exposed persons\u2019 suspected of involvement in foreign corruption, as well as suspected criminals, have acquired significant real estate interests and assets that are disproportionate to their lawful incomes. Targets of unexplained wealth orders are required to prove the circumstances surrounding ownership of such property and assets, which can be seized by the authorities under a court order. Unfortunately, several of the early targets have mounted successful challenges in the UK courts, diminishing the value of the new tool. More recently, the National Crime Agency has relied more heavily on a different tool known as account freeze and forfeiture orders, which can be secured in lower courts without having to prove criminal wrongdoing. The government also has occasionally used visa policy to send messages to prominent Russian business figures, such as Roman Abramovich, who had long been accustomed to using the country as a base outside Russia. Still, the outsized lobbying power of the UK financial, real estate, and corporate sectors has made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to overhaul the existing regulatory framework or to make the United Kingdom a less welcoming jurisdiction for Russian petro-dollars and illicit funds. The ISC report also draws attention to the weakness of the UK legal framework for responding to national security threats posed by Russia and other hostile foreign powers. It quotes then MI5 director general Andrew Parker, who said that the Official Secrets Act is \u201cdusty and largely ineffective\u201d because \u201cit was drafted for First World War days and was about sketches of naval dockyards, etc.\u201d  The law\u2019s shortcomings are particularly acute in light of the extensive Russian presence that moves freely in and out of the United Kingdom: \u201cUnder the Official Secrets Act as it exists now, anyone who is not a British national or a public servant does not commit an offence if they engage in espionage against the UK while abroad.\u201d  The ISC report also recommends that the United Kingdom develop a legal mechanism for disclosure by individuals acting on behalf of a foreign power modeled on the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act, which would be a positive step but hardly a decisive one. Meanwhile, Brexit is having a significant impact on how the United Kingdom operates on the global stage even as it further aggravates internal political divisions. For decades, the country grew accustomed to leveraging its role within the EU as a means to institutionalize its policy ideas and priorities globally via a powerful multilateral mechanism. The United Kingdom\u2019s impact is now being inexorably reduced as result of leaving the EU. The trusting relationship with key partners like Germany and France is also being severely tested by the increasingly acrimonious negotiations over the post-Brexit relationship with the EU. Societal fault lines exposed by Brexit, such as the possibility of a renewed push for Scottish independence, are also likely to prove quite harmful. For its part, the Kremlin typically relishes watching longtime adversaries experience such turmoil. It is hard to imagine that Moscow will not use some of the tools at its disposal, including information and influence operations, to amplify the United Kingdom\u2019s current misfortunes. It remains to be seen whether the Kremlin will go to great lengths to achieve its goals or simply decide to let the United Kingdom stew in its own juices. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Russia\u2019s policy toward core Europe has appeared to be stuck on autopilot. Instead of nimbly trying to exploit Europe\u2019s obvious internal divisions and ongoing tensions with the United States, the Kremlin has simply followed time-worn patterns, acting as though its most important goals could be accomplished simply by sticking to its guns and waiting for Europe to fall apart under the weight of the pandemic and other burdens. Yet this approach is not at all mindful of the galvanizing effect that the protests in Belarus and the attempted assassination of a major opposition political figure is having on German, French, and UK policy. Just as it was blindsided by the extent of Western unity in the wake of the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin today seems oblivious\u2014or simply indifferent\u2014to what its actions will mean for relations with core Europe. Nonetheless there is still considerable concern in some quarters in Berlin, Paris, and London that the Russian government may yet be able to capitalize on an approach that emphasizes strategic patience. After all, the Kremlin is betting, not unreasonably, that one of these days, the West will simply downgrade its long list of irritants and unresolvable disputes with Russia as it has in the past. In the meantime, the Putin regime is trying to intimidate European leaders, playing on perennial fears that things might get out of hand. The Kremlin also wants to convince Western counterparts that they have very little leverage over Russian behavior and to exacerbate the divisions that it believes can keep NATO and the EU bogged down in internal debates and disagreements. What is missing from the Kremlin\u2019s analysis of the current state of affairs is much self-awareness about how its recent behavior is potentially creating an epochal moment comparable to the events of 2014 in Ukraine. The Navalny attack and the crisis in Belarus have stripped away, practically overnight, the credibility of voices in Europe that traditionally advocate on behalf of preserving the status quo. In Germany, for example, the greatest pressure will not be faced by increasingly marginal constituencies like the   but rather by Christian Democrat stalwarts like Merkel and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier who call for finding ways to continue cooperation with Russia. Following the Navalny attack the percentage of Germans polled who want to tighten sanctions on Russia more than doubled to 34 percent compared with June 2019, according to a survey conducted in September 2020. \u00a0It is increasingly unclear whether arguments in favor of the status quo will hold sway as the end of the Merkel era and the general elections draw nearer. In France, these events are greatly complicating Macron\u2019s strategic dialogue with the Kremlin. It is hard to see how French officials can successfully argue within the Quad or in Brussels in favor of a more lenient approach on Russian matters at a time when Moscow\u2019s heavy-handed handling of the Navalny attack and the Belarus crisis generates such intense anger and frustration. In the meantime, Macron is gearing up for reelection in 2022 and appears to hope that he will once again face Le Pen, who has extremely limited ability to appeal to centrists or left-of-center voters. Still, if the impact of the pandemic continues to hang over French society and the economy, it is conceivable that Moscow will once again seek to play on societal divisions and amplify populist voices. At best, Russia\u2019s relations with Germany, France, and the United Kingdom will stay as they are now regardless of whether or not large-scale projects like Nord Stream 2 are frozen. In the same vein, Merkel\u2019s long-standing approach of balancing a tough-minded approach with various types of economic and energy cooperation is becoming more contested. In the run-up to next autumn\u2019s German elections, the stage is potentially being set for an approach toward Russia that prioritizes hard security, treats the Kremlin as an irredeemably dangerous and kleptocratic regime, and supports the imposition of ever greater economic and political costs for Russian misdeeds. At the same time, it is unlikely that mainstream political leaders from Germany, France, or the United Kingdom will be all that interested in resetting ties or that Moscow will succeed in pushing the EU\u2019s post-2014 framework to the breaking point. Still, Europe\u2019s leading powers remain challenged by their inability to mobilize the kind of hard power that matters most in today\u2019s world, especially for building leverage with Russia. It often appears that the leaders of Europe have forgotten how to play the game of power politics. As they find themselves being sucked once again into an era of so-called great-power competition, the Kremlin\u2019s modus operandi in foreign policy is likely to provide significant advantages. Against this backdrop, it is questionable that the biggest challenge for the transatlantic relationship is to hold another arid debate between the United States and its European allies on whether it is necessary to push back on a more assertive Russia. As Macron frequently likes to point out European leaders are not na\u00efve. They have a very solid grasp of whom they are dealing with in the Kremlin. Rather the real question for Western policymakers is how best to devise a proportionate and sustainable response to the threat posed by Russia and to manage ongoing tensions skillfully while preserving the unity of purpose that has served previous generations of Western leaders so well.  is the James Family Chair and a vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he oversees research in Washington and Moscow on Russia and Eurasia.

PETERSBURG, Russia -- U.S. tennis player   was placed in isolation by Russian authorities after testing positive for the coronavirus but left the country on a private plane, organizers of the St. Petersburg Open said Thursday. The tournament said Querrey and his wife tested positive Sunday, the day before main draw play started. They had tested negative on arrival in Russia four days earlier. He was withdrawn from the competition, and the family was asked to isolate together at a hotel. In a statement, the tournament said Querrey did not open the door to doctors who came to examine the family on Monday, saying his baby son was sleeping, and the family then left the hotel before a second scheduled examination the next day. \"Sam Querrey, as the hotel's security cameras identified, left the hotel together with his family at 5:45 a.m. on Oct. 13 without informing the reception service. As Querrey told an ATP representative, he left Russia with his family on a private plane,\" the tournament said, citing information from the ATP Tour. The ATP said it was investigating an incident at the tournament but did not name Querrey. \"The ATP is aware of an incident regarding a player's serious breach of protocol relating to COVID-19 at this week's St. Petersburg Open,\" the tour said. \"Adhering to health and safety protocols is critical to ensure events take place safely and within the guidelines established by local authorities. Players and their support team members are reminded that breaches of protocol can jeopardize an event's ability to operate and have repercussions on the rest of the Tour. In accordance with ATP's Code of Conduct, we are taking this matter extremely seriously and an investigation is underway.\" There was no immediate comment from a spokesperson for Querrey, who is ranked 49th in the world.

{"text": "World leaders call for halt to fighting that has killed more than 500 people in 17 days First published on Wed 14 Oct 2020 13.14 BST Russia has made a fresh appeal to Armenia and Azerbaijan to respect a badly fraying ceasefire in the breakaway South Caucasus region of  , with both sides blaming each other for fresh attacks, including on civilians. The truce was supposed to   but appears to be failing, with the defence ministry in Nagorno-Karabakh \u2013 a territory inside Azerbaijan but governed by ethnic Armenians \u2013 accusing   in several areas, and claiming to have shot down an Azeri Su-25 fighter jet, though Azerbaijan denies this. Baku has in turn accused Armenian forces of attacking Azeri army positions on the ceasefire line that divides the two sides and says several regions inside   have taken artillery fire, resulting in one new civilian death and several wounded, including Azeri journalists. It has also accused Armenian forces of trying to take control of gas and oil pipelines that are a crucial artery for energy from the Caspian sea to international markets. Both sides have denied breaking the ceasefire, though not unequivocally. Azerbaijan said on Wednesday it reserved the right to hit any military installations that targeted civilians and to repel movements into its territory. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made the new appeal for peace by telephone to the Azeri and Armenian defence ministers, urging the countries to \u201cfully meet the commitments\u201d made under the humanitarian ceasefire brokered by Moscow. Russia has also floated the idea of deploying \u201cmilitary observers\u201d to monitor the ceasefire but said it would need the consent of both Baku and Yerevan to do so. The ceasefire is buckling despite mounting calls from world powers to halt the fighting, which has killed more than 500 people since the decades-old conflict flared up on 27 September. International groups have warned of a humanitarian crisis, with   and a growing Covid-19 pandemic. The fighting is the worst since a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh that killed about 30,000 people. It is being closely watched abroad, partly over fears that Russia and   could be sucked in. Russia has a defence pact with Armenia, and  In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Armenia\u2019s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, accused Turkey of muscling its way into the South Caucasus region to further what he called its expansionist ambitions. Turkey has denied this and says Armenian forces must withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh to resolve the conflict.  \u2013 called on the Armenian and Azeri leaders on Tuesday to implement the ceasefire to prevent \u201ccatastrophic consequences for the region\u201d. The 11-member group is led by the US, Russia and France. Turkey is also a member but not involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh talks, though it has said it wants to join them. The Azeri president, Ilham Aliyev, said on Wednesday that Turkey should be involved in peace talks and that the conflict could not be solved without Ankara\u2019s involvement. In an interview with the Turkish broadcaster Habert\u00fcrk, Aliyev also said Turkish F-16 jets were in Azerbaijan, but that they were not being used in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azeri and ethnic Armenian forces. \u201cArmenia is trying to attack and take control of our pipelines,\u201d Aliyev said. \u201cIf Armenia tries to take control of the pipelines there, I can say that the outcome will be severe for them.\u201d Though Russia has sought to play a mediating role, there are fears it could be dragged in should the conflict escalate. Moscow has a military treaty that calls for it to assist Armenia should its sovereignty be threatened \u2013 though it has made clear it does not regard defending Nagorno-Karabakh as part of its obligations. Oil-rich Azerbaijan is thought to be better resourced to fight a drawn-out conflict, which it could use to draw concessions from Armenia. But Yerevan could also raise the stakes by recognising the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh and openly attacking Azerbaijan from its territory, including with high-precision Iskander surface-to-surface missile systems supplied by Russia. A larger-scale war would be likely to draw greater international engagement by increasing the risk of damage to the oil and gas pipelines that flow from Azerbaijan into global markets and run in places only 10 miles from the Armenian border. The US presidential candidate Joe Biden expressed deep concern over the collapse of the ceasefire and accused the Trump administration of being \u201clargely passive and disengaged\u201d. \u201cRather than delegating the diplomacy to Moscow, the administration must get more involved, at the highest levels,\u201d Biden said in a statement. Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said on Tuesday that 532 servicemen had been killed since fighting flared on 27 September. They did not immediately update the death toll on Wednesday. The latest death reported by Azerbaijan\u2019s prosecutor general appeared to take the toll to 43 Azeri civilian deaths since the outbreak of fighting 17 days ago. Azerbaijan has not disclosed military casualties. "},
{"text": "Yandex is the crown jewel of Russia\u2019s silicon valley\u2014but is often caught between the demands of the government and Wall Street. Russia\u2019s biggest technology company enjoys a level of dominance that is unparalleled by any one of its Western counterparts. Think Google mixed with equal parts Amazon, Spotify and Uber and you\u2019re getting close to the sprawling empire that is Yandex\u2014a single, mega-corporation with its hands in everything from search to ecommerce to driverless cars.\u00a0 But being the crown jewel of Russia\u2019s silicon valley has its drawbacks. The country\u2019s government sees the internet as contested territory amid ever-present tensions with US and other Western interests. As such, it wants influence over how Yandex uses its massive trove of data on Russian citizens. Foreign investors, meanwhile, are more interested in how that data can be turned into growth and profit.\u00a0  of MIT Technology Review, Moscow-based journalist Evan Gershkovich explains how Yandex\u2019s ability to walk   could potentially serve as a kind of template for Big Tech. This week on Deep Tech, he joins our editor-in-chief, Gideon Lichfield, to discuss how, in a world where the debates over regulating Big Tech are intensifying, this isn\u2019t just a Russian story.\u00a0 Imagine a world where Google, Amazon, Spotify, and Uber are all one company. Everything from your morning news, music, and groceries, to your taxi home at night all delivered and operated by a single mega-corporation. Well, head over to Russia and you\u2019ll find that world is very much a reality.\u00a0 Yandex is the crown jewel of Russia\u2019s Silicon Valley. It has its hands in everything from search to autonomous vehicles. It even got an extra boost from the coronavirus pandemic.   for the company\u2019s delivery apps grew   in the second quarter of this year.\u00a0 But that success comes at a price. Russia has long-viewed the internet as a battleground in its escalating tensions with the West.\u00a0 of Russia\u2019s power-brokers think Yandex is under too much foreign influence. They want Russia to have ultimate control of the massive amounts of data that tech companies hold on Russian citizens. That means Yandex periodically gets caught between the demands of the Kremlin and of the foreign investors who hold most of its stock. But as we\u2019ll see today, in a world where the debates over how to regulate Big Tech are intensifying, this isn\u2019t just the Russian story.\u00a0 Today, I\u2019m talking to Evan Gershkovich, a journalist for the Moscow Times. He wrote a story in our latest issue\u2014the techno-nationalism issue\u2014about Yandex\u2019s balancing act, and how it  be seen as a kind of template for tech companies in the rest of the world. I\u2019m Gideon Lichfield, editor-in-chief of MIT Technology Review, and  So Evan, when I lived in Moscow 15 years ago, people were already using Yandex Search and Yandex Maps and Yandex Translate, but it seems to have become way, way bigger since then. Can you give us a sense of how important it is?\u00a0 Yandex started expanding very much in the way that Google did over the years, starting from just a search engine to becoming a service that provided...or a company that provided a variety of different services. And now when you live in Moscow, 15 years later, So many services are connected to this company from ordering food to ride sharing services, to figuring out what movies you're going to watch. And this year during the coronavirus crisis when Moscow was under lockdown, Yandex really became this sort of all-encompassing company because people relied on its taxi service and people also used its food delivery services to ensure they weren't going to the supermarket so much. So it really became this sort of dominant presence in our lives here. How did Yandex get to be so totally dominant in, in a way that not even Google is in the West? How does it beat out the competition?\u00a0 What the company will tell you when you ask them this question is that it's through this diversification. About 10 years ago, around 2012, 2013, the company decided to start diversifying way beyond just the search and the maps, like you had mentioned. If you look at, you know, their movie recommending service, or if you look at their website that they have where you can buy cars or Navigator, they all have a competitor in Russia. So they don't dominate every single industry fully, but they are pretty much everywhere. And in this way, you just, you know, anything you try to do online in Russia, Yandex comes up as a very plausible tool that you would use. There's this phenomenon in China, where the government went out of its way to help local tech giants beat out foreign competition. And one of the big things there, of course, is that the local firms are willing to cooperate with surveillance and censorship in a way that Google isn't, for example. But in Russia, Yandex didn't really have that sort of help, did it? It just kind of grew by itself.\u00a0 Yeah, absolutely. For years the Kremlin and other state security services didn't really pay attention to the internet all that much. They were, the authorities here and Russia, were quite slow to coming around to the idea that this was an area that they should pay attention to. And this could be paradoxical or sound odd to a Western audience, but for years, Russia's internet was really the freest internet or.. one of the freest internets that there was in the world. So Yandex, which started in 97\u2019 and grew in the early aughts and through the 2010s, at that point, really, it wasn't touched. And so it was free to develop how it wanted to.\u00a0 And when did this mentality of the Kremlin start to change? When did they start to think that a company as powerful as Yandex was going to be a problem? One of the first moments was in 2008 when Russia fought a five day war with Georgia.\u00a0 One of Yandex's services is called Yandex News, it's a sort of a news aggregator very similar to Google News. And at that point Russian media was much more diversified. There was many more independent and liberal outlets. And so Yandex's aggregator was picking up liberal and independent media news about the war and putting it in its feed and that really upset the Kremlin, which wanted its viewpoint to be highlighted. Several years later when the Arab Spring swept across the Middle East in 2011, and then protests kicked off in Moscow against Vladimir Putin's rule in Russia a few months later, that   was really sort of this moment where the Kremlin saw the internet specifically as an arena that could be influential. Because all those protests in the Arab Spring and then in Moscow were organized through Facebook and similar social media tools. The Kremlin realized what power that the internet actually could have. So in both the war three years earlier in 2008, and then in 2011 during these mass protests, it started to sort of realize that this was an arena that it would if not control, at least pay close attention to. And what kind of pressure did it start to put on Yandex? So one of the first moments of pressure that Yandex actually faced was a potential takeover by Kremlin-linked oligarch Alisher Usmanov. He lobbied for the Kremlin support on national security grounds to take over the company. And a year later, in 2009, Yandex handed Russia's largest lender, the state owned Sberbank a so-called \u201cgolden share,\u201d which allowed the bank to veto transactions involving more than a quarter of Yandex's stock. And this was essentially meant to satisfy the Kremlin that if there were any transactions the authorities weren't happy with, they would be able to step in and limit them.\u00a0 And what's been going on in the years since then?  So for about a decade this sort of golden-share arrangement seemed to satisfy the Kremlin and interest in Yandex pretty much waxed and waned. It was sort of left to its own devices until the fall of 2018 when rumors surfaced that Sberbank was now hoping to buy a 30% stake in Yandex to protect it from so-called \"potential trouble.\" That morning in New York, when trading opened up // the company lost a billion dollars in market value over these worries. Now How much leverage do you think Yandex has? It\u2019s one of Russia\u2019s biggest companies. It\u2019s majority owned by foreign investors. And obviously if Russia clips its wings, its share price would take a huge hit. Does that matter, do you think, to the authorities? To the authorities, it seems like, not so much. Often it makes these decisions out of purely, you know, their own interests. But when there were these rumors that we spoke about, about Sberbank buying a 30% share in Yandex, it really appeared to be that that was coming from the Kremlin saying, you know, we have to sort of rein in Yandex.\u00a0 And Yandex solved that with what seems to be a really neat solution. It took about a year, but they changed that golden-share, that veto power over major transactions into what they called the Public Interest Foundation. And this foundation has 11 seats on its board. Three belong to Yandex. And the other eight are divided up among influential business groups and state-affiliated universities. And this structure now has that veto power that used to be with Sberbank.\u00a0 It seems like the Kremlin's policy towards Yandex varies a lot. Sometimes it's really concerned about foreign influence. Sometimes it just sort of lets it go. Why is there this inconsistency?\u00a0  So we've been speaking so far about the Kremlin as this sort of single entity. But to understand power in Russia, you need to understand more than just the Kremlin. The authorities are actually made up of these various rival groups. And there's a specific constituency that's known in Russian as the  . These are officials with ties to law enforcement.\u00a0 These are basically hardliners who are very protective of the regime and they aim to control all facets of society. Including the internet, which in recent years as conflict with the West has renewed, it\u2019s become one of these arenas they very much wanted to control. And Yandex for its part as this major tech company\u00a0 in Russia has gotten caught up in the middle of that process.\u00a0 \u00a0And this is something I actually talked about with Tatiana Stanovaya, who is the founder of Russian political analysis site R.Politik. From her perspective, she says that for the  , the Yandex foundation was seen as a half-victory.\u00a0  Tatiana says that the Public Interest Foundation has three main functions. The first is to block deals that would concentrate more than 10% of Yandex\u2019s stock under a single owner. The second is to control operations involving intellectual property. And third, and this is another sensitive subject for the   involves control of personal data. So where we are today is that Russia is talking about much tighter constraints on the internet. Talk to us a bit about what's been happening there.  So in recent years, Russia has passed two key laws that have affected internet companies. The first one requires them to store data on servers in Russia and not anywhere abroad. And the second law is this notorious, so-called Sovereign Internet Law. This means that a state owned communications infrastructure would be created, that would allow the country to cut itself off from the global internet. What this means is that there would be a sort of a bubble of sorts of Russian own services that would create an internet that would only be Russian. And from the Kremlin's perspective, what it sees through the sovereign internet would be a way to control what its citizens can see online.\u00a0 So it sounds like Russia is going for something much closer to China\u2019s model of the internet, where tech platforms can really only operate if they\u2019re friendly to the government?\u00a0 Yes and no simultaneously. So yes, in that it's attempting to, but one of the main things in recent years has been the fact that a lot of these ventures haven't really succeeded.\u00a0 One of the key moments in the past few years was when Russia tried to block a popular messenger app here called Telegram. And for about a year, it stated that that app was blocked. All the while, authorities kept using it themselves, including state media channels and even the Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov used it himself to communicate with foreign journalists. So it became the sort of farcical, absurdist thing where the country said this technological service was blocked\u2014but it wasn't able to block it. And a year and a half later, it just announced \u201cyou know what? It's no longer blocked.\u201d So with the sovereign internet it does remain to be seen whether this is something that Russia is actually able to pull off. And so while it may want to be China in this sort of way, it sometimes falls short. What would it mean for a company like Yandex if the Sovereign Internet Law really goes fully into effect? It would be massive. Yandex has been hoping to expand its business beyond Russia's borders for a long time. It hasn't been incredibly successful at that, but there are some ways that it's been you know, reaching out beyond Russia recently. Its driverless car program has been piloted in Detroit and in Las Vegas and in Israel. The more Russia tries to cut off from the global internet, the more that would hamper a company like Yandex\u2014which is hoping to be not just Russian, but global. So this at one level seems like a very specifically Russian story. There's this big company. It dominates practically every area of its industry. It's in this cozy, but tense relationship with the Kremlin. It's had to make some concessions. And yet at the end of your piece, you argue that this relationship with the government is something that Western tech companies might have to start emulating. Right. Even, you know, companies like Google and Facebook have started coming under pressure namely for what's seen as their opaque content moderation processes. And this year, Facebook, in response to that, created this so-called oversight board. It's similar to how Yandex\u2019s Public Interest Foundation has universities and big companies that are part of it. Facebook's oversight board has legal and human rights luminaries who are able to review and overturn some of the platform's decisions. So this is sort of like a small scale version of what Yandex's Public Interest Foundation is. And it may sort of foretell you know not just the sorts of demands that a company like Google and Facebook may face going forward, but the solutions that they might come up with to retain some sort of independence in the way that Yandex has here in Russia.

{"text": "Fueled by the pandemic, uprisings in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan and a war in the Caucasus region are undermining the influence of the Russian leader. YEREVAN, Armenia \u2014 In Russia\u2019s self-proclaimed sphere of influence, Russia is losing its influence. Concurrent crises in Belarus, Central Asia and the Caucasus region have blindsided the Kremlin, leaving it scrambling to shore up Russian interests in former Soviet republics and undermining President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s image as a master tactician on the world stage. \u201cThere is nothing good about these conflicts for Moscow,\u201d Konstantin Zatulin, a senior Russian lawmaker and Putin ally who specializes in relations with what Russians call their \u201cnear abroad.\u201d Mr. Putin has spent years building up Russia as a global power, with a hand in hot spots from Latin America to the Middle East, and even meddling in presidential elections in the United States. But after working for years to destabilize the West, he suddenly finds himself surrounded by instability; once seen as sure-handed in foreign affairs, he seems to have lost his touch. In Belarus, Mr. Putin responded to a street uprising in August by propping up the country\u2019s unpopular autocrat, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, turning public opinion against Russia in what had previously been Europe\u2019s most Russia-friendly country.  in Central Asia, protesters this week appeared  President Sooronbai Jeenbekov, less than two weeks after Mr. Putin   in a rare in-person meeting that \u201cwe will do everything to support you as the head of state.\u201d And in the Caucasus, the long-simmering conflict between   over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh erupted last week into  , threatening to undo the balancing act that had allowed Russia to cultivate diverse links to the region. \u201cRussia was doing all it could to maintain ties both with Azerbaijan and Armenia,\u201d Mr. Zatulin said. \u201cEvery day of conflict in Karabakh is, effectively, helping zero out Russia\u2019s authority.\u201d The spate of new challenges to Russian influence strikes at the heart of Mr. Putin\u2019s yearslong effort to cast himself as the leader who restored the great-power status that the nation lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even as the Kremlin denied Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election, Russian state television gleefully reported on the American allegations of that interference as a sign that Moscow was being reckoned with again on the world stage. Now, rather than react decisively to emergencies close to home, Mr. Putin sounds ambivalent about Russia\u2019s role. \u201cWe hope the conflict will end very soon,\u201d he said of Nagorno-Karabakh, in a television interview broadcast Wednesday. Minutes later, referring to Kyrgyzstan, he said, \u201cWe hope that everything will be peaceful.\u201d The confluence of crises in Russia\u2019s own neighborhood is such that some pro-Kremlin commentators   of an organized campaign to sow discord in the post-Soviet regions. More balanced analysts, however, have singled out one constant factor in the growing unrest. Both Russia and its neighbors, they say, have been destabilized by the coronavirus pandemic, which has exposed distrust in institutions and in out-of-touch leaders across the region.  between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and in Belarus and in Kyrgyzstan, the disease set the stage for public uprisings by exposing the ruling elite as disconnected from people\u2019s suffering. Mr. Lukashenko angered Belarusians by playing down the danger of the virus, joking that  ; in Kyrgyzstan, critics blamed officials for using coronavirus aid money to enrich themselves. Within Russia, the economic hardship caused by the pandemic has helped deepen public anger against Mr. Putin. In the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk, for example, thousands of protesters   spilled into the streets last Saturday for the 13th week in a row. Some analysts say that public discontent within Russia means that Mr. Putin needs to turn more of his focus to domestic issues such as economy hardship, pollution and poor health care, rather than delving into global geopolitics. But developments in recent weeks have given Mr. Putin more reason to focus on the latter. \u201cFor Putin, practically his entire mission and his vision of Russian greatness and success revolve around his foreign-policy agenda,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research organization focused on politics and policy. The new series of crises, she went on, \u201cwill very much distract Putin from domestic problems.\u201d The centrality of the former Soviet lands to Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy was evident in the   of world leaders who called Mr. Putin to wish him a happy birthday on Wednesday, when he turned 68. Of the 12 who called, only three leaders \u2014 those of Israel, India and Cuba \u2014 head countries outside the former Soviet Union. In Armenia, which hosts a Russian military base, some hope for a more forceful stance by Russia in the conflict, which has already killed at least 250 people, according to official reports. But Russia\u2019s ability to influence events in the Caucasus now appears limited, despite its past role as a mediator in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Turkey, Azerbaijan\u2019s most important ally, has taken on  \u201cTurkey, indeed, in this current situation probably should be considered as a balance to unilateral Russian interference,\u201d said Farid Shafiyev, chairman of the Center of Analysis of International Relations in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku. In the Caucasus, he added, \u201cthe Russian role is probably diminishing.\u201d Across the former Soviet Union, Russian remains the lingua franca, and the proliferation of mostly uncensored internet access across the region means that protests in one country can easily inspire a disenchanted populace in another. Some protesters in Belarus carried signs supporting the demonstrations in Khabarovsk, over 4,000 miles away. And ahead of Kyrgyzstan\u2019s parliamentary elections last Sunday, government critics were keeping an eye on Belarus, where it was a blatantly falsified election in August that sparked the uprising against Mr. Lukashenko. \u201cIn Kyrgyzstan it was often said that we will copy the Belarusians,\u201d said Aybek Sultangaziyev, director of a news agency in Kyrgyzstan, K-News. \u201cIn fact, we surpassed the Belarusians in effectiveness and precision.\u201d Mr. Sultangaziyev said that if his country\u2019s uprising succeeds, the new leadership will seek to maintain close ties with Moscow. In Armenia, too, the government of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan retained its alliance with Russia after the prime minister came to power in a popular uprising in 2018. \u201cWe have never been pro-Western or pro-Eastern,\u201d said Ruben Rubinyan, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Armenian Parliament. \u201cRussia has been and is an ally of Armenia, a very important ally.\u201d But, for Moscow, recent events in Belarus offer a cautionary tale that illustrates the fragility of Russia\u2019s standing among its neighbors \u2014 carrying echoes of Ukraine\u2019s   from Russia\u2019s orbit in 2014. Some Belarusians who had been well disposed toward Mr. Putin turned against him after he propped up Mr. Lukashenko in the face of the protests. Mr. Zatulin, the Russian lawmaker, said officials \u201cat the highest levels of the Russian Federation\u201d believed that Mr. Lukashenko would need to step down \u201csooner or later.\u201d But Mr. Lukashenko had argued to Russian officials, Mr. Zatulin said, that his stepping down in the face of street protests could set a dangerous precedent for what might happen to Mr. Putin himself. \u201cBy unconditionally supporting Lukashenko, we are creating an enormous problem for ourselves in the future with the majority or a significant part of the Belarusian population,\u201d Mr. Zatulin said. \u201cWe are creating a problem for ourselves with the other Belarusian politicians and public figures, who are increasingly forced to seek sympathy in the West. Russia wants that least of all.\u201d Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow. "},

{"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A New York tabloid\u2019s puzzling account about how it acquired emails purportedly from Joe Biden\u2019s son has raised some red flags. One of the biggest involves the source of the emails: Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani has traveled abroad looking for dirt on the Bidens, developing relationships with shadowy figures, including a Ukrainian lawmaker who U.S. officials have described as a Russian agent and part of a broader Russian effort to denigrate the Democratic presidential nominee. Yet Giuliani says foreign sources didn\u2019t provide the Hunter Biden emails. He says a laptop containing the emails and intimate photos was simply abandoned in a Delaware repair shop and the shop owner reached out to Giuliani\u2019s lawyer. That hasn\u2019t stopped the FBI from investigating whether the emails are part of a foreign influence operation. The emails have surfaced as U.S. officials have been warning that Russia, which backed Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign through hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign, is interfering again this year. The latest episode with Giuliani underscores the risk he poses to a White House that spent years confronted by a federal investigation into whether Trump associates had coordinated with Russia. The Washington Post reported Thursday that intelligence agencies had warned the White House last year that Giuliani was the target of a Russian influence operation. The newspaper, citing four former officials, said that assessment was based on information including intercepted communications showing Giuliani had been in contact with people tied to Russian intelligence. The newspaper said national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien had warned Trump that information Giuliani brought back from Ukraine should be considered contaminated by Russia, but that Trump brushed off the warning. Far from distancing himself from Giuliani, Trump has made the purported Hunter Biden emails one of his main talking points in the final weeks of the campaign as he tries to disparage his Democratic rival. The Trump-friendly New York Post began publishing stories about the emails Wednesday, saying it had obtained them from the former New York mayor. The newspaper said the emails of Hunter Biden, a California resident, were found in a laptop that had been dropped off for service at a Delaware repair shop by an unidentified man who never picked it up. They said the shop owner turned it over to the FBI, but also made a copy of the hard drive and provided that to Giuliani\u2019s lawyer. One 2015 email published by the Post purported to show a top adviser for Burisma, the Ukraine gas company where Hunter Biden held a board seat, thanking Biden for giving him an opportunity to meet his father when the older Biden was serving as U.S. vice president. The Biden campaign and a lawyer for Hunter Biden said they had no record of such a meeting taking place. They have not addressed the authenticity of the emails. Giuliani did not respond Friday for a request for comment from The Associated Press. But in an interview Thursday with a SiriusXM show, he asserted that the laptop had been dropped off by Hunter Biden, and that the material was not hacked and the laptop was legally obtained. He said on Fox News on Friday that the information from the laptop was \u201cauthentic as hell.\u201d The FBI is investigating whether the emails are tied to a foreign influence operation, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity to AP. The exact scope of what was being investigated was not clear. But the report that intelligence agencies have been concerned about Giuliani is hardly surprising.  Andrii Derkach, the Ukrainian parliamentarian who is one of Giuliani\u2019s principal contacts, was mentioned in an August intelligence assessment that described a concerted Russian effort to disparage Biden. A Treasury Department sanction announcement from last month characterized Derkach as an \u201cactive Russian agent for over a decade.\u201d Derkach in recent months has leaked recordings of calls Biden had as vice president with Ukraine\u2019s then-leader, audio the Biden campaign contends is heavily edited. Despite his own administration\u2019s warnings on Derkach, Trump has promoted those recordings on Twitter. Giuliani has not been shy about discussing his foreign contacts, including with Derkach. In December, Derkach posted on his Facebook page photos of him and Giuliani meeting in Kyiv. Frustration about Giuliani in the West Wing has long run rampant, with those around the president warily watching Giuliani\u2019s efforts to bring down the Bidens and fearful they could boomerang back on the president.  Giuliani was central to advancing a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election. His shadowy efforts to get Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens helped create the impeachment case against Trump. Even detractors in the president\u2019s orbit recognize Giuliani as a force in Trump\u2019s defense during the lengthy Russia investigation by the special counsel. The probe detailed extensive contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia but did not allege a criminal conspiracy between the two to tip the 2016 election. Yet the effort to undermine Robert Mueller led Giuliani to Ukraine, which many feel directly led to Trump\u2019s impeachment. He was acquitted by the Senate in February. After long struggling to find a cable-ready defender, Trump has been mostly appreciative of Giuliani\u2019s attack-dog style \u2014 and, for a time, his broadsides against Mueller appeared to play a role in driving down the special counsel\u2019s approval ratings. But at other times, the president has expressed private dismay at Giuliani\u2019s scattershot style. Some around Trump fear that the case being made against the younger Biden has been weakened because Giuliani has become its face. The Trump campaign has been pushing allegations of corruption against the Bidens for more than a year, with the president advancing the widely discredited theory that the vice president sought to force out Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor to protect his son from scrutiny. Though Trump associates believe a case can be made that Hunter enriched himself by selling access to his father, they fear that Giuliani\u2019s lack of credibility will cause the allegations to implode.

{"text": "The Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), horrible enough in its own time, seems almost quaint in ours. World Wars I and II have redefined \u201chorrible.\u201d It began abruptly and was soon over. \u201cThe victories on land and sea were dramatic and clear-cut,\u201d writes historian Richard Storry in \u201cA History of Modern Japan.\u201d \u201cBoth sides fought with remarkable courage, and with some chivalry. Japanese treatment of Russian prisoners was more than correct: it was generous and humane.\u201d The West looked on, intrigued and impressed, as \u201c\u2018Gallant Little Japan\u2019 (stood) up to the Russian Bear.\u201d Gen. Maresuke Nogi (1849-1912) is the name that, above all others, survives from that distant clash. Nogi outlives his war. He outlives himself. The manner of his death conferred immortality. Myth never dies. In 1912, seven years after his capture, at such high cost, of the Russian fortress of Port Arthur in Manchuria and six weeks after the death of Emperor Meiji, Nogi and his wife, Shizuko, committed   \u2014 the ancient ritual of following one\u2019s lord in death. Historian Herbert Bix describes the scene in \u201cHirohito and the Making of Modern Japan\u201d: \u201cOn the day of the Emperor Meiji\u2019s funeral (Sept 13, 1912), General Nogi and his wife closed the door to their second-floor living room and prepared to end their lives. He had removed his uniform and was clad in white undergarments; she wore black funeral attire. They bowed to portraits of Meiji and of their two sons killed in the Russo-Japanese War. While the funeral bells tolled, they proceeded to commit ritual suicide. Mrs. Nogi acted first; he assisted, plunging a dagger into her neck, and then he disemboweled himself with a sword.\u201d Historical novelist Ryotaro Shiba, in \u201cClouds Above the Hill,\u201d jabs a poison pen into the Nogi myth. \u201cIn the history of warfare,\u201d he writes, \u201cno battle plan is as idiotic as (the) third assault on Port Arthur carried out by Nogi and (chief of staff Kosuke) Ichiji.\u201d The other assaults were little better, in Shiba\u2019s view \u2014 \u201churling flesh and blood at concrete.\u201d So much, he says, for Nogi\u2019s generalship. For five months the siege ground on \u2014 wave after human wave repulsed by Russian artillery. Port Arthur was a prize harbor, ice-free in winter. Ten years earlier Japan had seized it from China, Nogi playing a leading role in the battle and subsequent massacre. There then occurred that fateful diplomatic coup known as the Triple Intervention. Russia, itself deeply involved in northern China, backed by France and Germany, demanded that Japan surrender the port. Japan grudgingly complied, nursed its wounds, bided its time and, in 1904, returned, seeking revenge. The Russians fortified their new harbor in proportion to its value \u2014 very strongly. Most of the Russian fleet \u2014 overwhelmingly larger than Japan\u2019s \u2014 was there, Vladivostok being iced over in winter. Japan\u2019s challenge was to destroy the fleet. Torpedoes were called for. But how could Japanese destroyers get close enough? An early surprise attack in February 1904 \u2014 likened in later years to the one at Pearl Harbor \u2014 did little damage. There were no shortcuts. The fortifications must be neutralized. Enter Nogi \u2014 a 19th-century soldier fighting a 20th-century war. A contemporary memoirist, whom Shiba quotes, vents his fury: \u201cIt was our moment in the new 20th century. What in blazes were we doing with antiquated bronze cannons?\u201d \u201cThere was an inherent tendency in the army to look down on technology, even to take pride in countering enemy technology with Japanese courage and human bullets,\u201d Shiba writes. \u201cEach Russian battery was equipped with a large number of machine guns. For Japanese troops at the front line ordered to attack with bayonets, nothing was so fearful as this new weapon. \u2026 All the defenders had to do was mow them down as they came.\u201d Which the defenders did, with merciless, mechanical, 20th-century speed and efficiency. \u201cNogi was no coward,\u201d Shiba adds. \u201cTo raise the men\u2019s morale, he frequently rode his horse to the front amid a hail of bursting shells. But even when he saw with his own eyes the horrors of the front, working out a new strategy was beyond him.\u201d And so the human wave flowed on. \u201cEven more surprising than (the) failure of leadership,\u201d writes Shiba, \u201cis the docility with which nameless soldiers of Meiji Japan went obediently to their deaths.\u201d Storry sketches a very different Nogi: \u201cA particularly dedicated general who held steadfast to all that was best in the samurai tradition. Off the battlefield no less than on it, Nogi imposed an extremely high standard of discipline upon his troops \u2014 the slightest misdemeanor towards civilian life or property was very severely punished.\u201d Japan\u2019s World War II conduct was much less gentlemanly. It took five months and 60,000 Japanese casualties, but Port Arthur was Japan\u2019s at last. It fell on the last day of 1904. Now the Imperial Japanese Navy\u2019s hands were untied. Adm. Heihachiro Togo, the other hero of the war, rose to the occasion, destroying the Russian fleet at Port Arthur and in the strait between Japan and Korea. Would either man have known, or cared, that Japan\u2019s victory sped on one of the great convulsions of the 20th century, its impact still reverberating in the 21st \u2014 namely the Russian Revolution? Nogi was evidently a man of deep and complex character. He was, among so many other things, a poet \u2014 a person of deep feeling, as poets tend to be. Of his siege of Port Arthur he wrote: This is the second of two parts on the Russo-Japanese War.

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The head of Russia\u2019s space agency said that the lunar Gateway, part of NASA\u2019s Artemis lunar exploration program, is too \u201cU.S.-centric\u201d for it to participate in, even though the Gateway leverages the existing International Space Station partnership. During a panel featuring the heads of seven space agencies at the International Astronautical Congress Oct. 12, Dmitry Rogozin, director general of Roscosmos, said it was unlikely that his agency would play a major role in the Gateway despite the planned participation of other ISS partners, including Canada, Europe and Japan. \u201cIn our view, the lunar Gateway in its current form is too U.S.-centric, so to speak,\u201d Rogozin said through an interpreter. \u201cRussia is likely to refrain from participating in it on a large scale.\u201d During a later press conference, Rogozin elaborated on his issues with the Gateway. \u201cThe most important thing here would be to base this program on the principles of international cooperation which were used in order to fly the ISS program,\u201d he said, such as collective decision-making among the station\u2019s partners.  \u201cIf we could get back to considering making these principles as the foundation of the program, then Roscosmos could also consider its participation,\u201d he said of the Gateway. Rogozin\u2019s comments about seeking to use the ISS as a model for the lunar Gateway are surprising since that is already NASA\u2019s approach for developing it. NASA previously announced it would extend the existing intergovernmental agreement, or IGA, for the space station for the Gateway, even as it seeks a new set of agreements, called the Artemis Accords, for the broader Artemis program. \u201cThe Gateway uses the intergovernmental agreement established for the International Space Station,\u201d NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in an interview after the conference session. \u201cAll of the protocols that exist on the International Space Station would also exist for the Gateway, so I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a challenge.\u201d NASA has been working with each ISS partner on memorandums of understanding (MOU) that would extend that ISS agreement for use on the Gateway. Bridenstine said that, in February, NASA asked Roscosmos for comments on how a potential MOU between the two agencies would work. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting to hear back from them,\u201d he said. Rogozin said that even if Russia does not decide to participate in the Gateway, he wanted to ensure that it used standard docking interfaces so that Russian spacecraft could dock with it. \u201cWe need to have at least two space transportation systems,\u201d he said, referring to Russian plans for a next-generation crewed spacecraft called Orel. Standards for docking would enable Orel to dock with the Gateway \u201ceven if we pursue two standalone programs.\u201d NASA is already pursuing such standards, Bridenstine said. \u201cWe are in broad agreement with Roscosmos that we need international standards for interoperability,\u201d he said, including not just docking but other areas, from communications to life support systems. Interoperability, he noted, is one of the principles of the Artemis Accords. He also supported development of a Russian transportation system that could deliver crews to the Gateway. \u201cIf we have dissimilar redundancy for transportation to the Gateway, and ultimately to the moon, that\u2019s very positive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very supportive of that.\u201d \u201cWhat the Artemis Accords are really about is coming up with those foundational principles that we all agree on so that when we go explore these worlds together, there\u2019s commonality,\u201d Bridenstine said at the press conference. \u201cThe whole purpose of it is to prevent misperceptions.\u201d 2020 Spacenews, Inc.

The Geneva-based monitoring NGO UN Watch described the situation as the equivalent of allowing five convicted arsonists to join the fire brigade. The UN has 15 three-year term vacancies on the 47-strong council, with the seats grouped into five regions. Due to secretive backroom deals, the only regional group in which seats are being contested is in Asiaand the Pacific, where five candidates are vying for four available seats. A candidate can only be defeated if fewer than 97 countries positively vote for them in the secret ballot at the UN general assembly in New York. At a briefing organised by UN Watch, Yang Jianli, the president of Citizen Power Initiatives for China and a former political prisoner, said: \u201cChina was involved in the annihilation of  . By any standards China has grossly abused the UN human rights founding principles. If this were an election for a UN human rights abusers council, it would be more than proper to vote for China, since it leads the world in violating human rights.\u201d He said democracies had a duty to vote against Beijing, and that victims of human rights abuses in   deserved to know how those democracies voted in the secret ballot. Rosa Mar\u00eda Pay\u00e1, a Cuban human rights activist and daughter of the late dissident Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, whose family say he was murdered, claimed that \u201cCuba uses the seat to protect their impunity, making sure the multiple accusations against them and criminal friends in Venezuela, China,   do not prosper. These groups act in gangs conspiring together to cover up the facts and empty the human rights council of content and effectiveness.\u201d Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian dissident who was twice poisoned, said seasoned UN watchers were rarely surprised, pointing out that regimes in Libya, Sudan and in Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq had in the past been elected to the council.  \u201cYet we still find it astonishing that Russia is considered a legitimate candidate let alone that it is likely to be elected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has \u2026 been confirmed \u2026 that [the Russian opposition leader]   by a highly controlled military grade nerve agent produced by the Russian state that has been used for years by the Russian security services, leaving no doubt who was behind this attack.\u201d He pointed out the UN says countries on the human rights council must \u201cuphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights\u201d.  \u201cIf this is to have any meaning the worst abusers of human rights should not be allowed to be given a seal of approval,\u201d said Kara-Murza. Alongside Saudi Arabia and China, Nepal,   and Uzbekistan are also vying for the four seats available to the Asia and Pacific group. Four countries have announced candidacies for the four Africa group seats: Ivory Coast, Senegal, Malawi and Gabon. In addition to Russia, Ukraine is seeking one of two eastern European group seats. In the Latin American and Caribbean group, Mexico, Cuba and Bolivia are running unopposed for three seats. In the western European section, France and Britain will take the two available seats.  two years ago, which campaigners say has strengthened the authoritarian view that human rights should be measured through the prism of economics as opposed to individual freedom. Although human rights groups are often critical of the council, they say it provides a rare platform for NGOs to directly confront repressive regimes. "},
{"text": "The poisoning of Aleksei A. Navalny could be a chance for Berlin to take a tougher stance against Moscow. But experts remain skeptical. BERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s bedside visit to Aleksei A. Navalny after he emerged from a coma while recovering from a poisoning was not a secret, her office insisted. Nor was it official.  Russia\u2019s leading opposition figure, was a purely private affair, her spokesman said. Neither Mr. Navalny\u2019s full military police escort to the Charit\u00e9 hospital upon his arrival in Berlin by air ambulance in August nor the dispatching of a security detail that has watched over him ever since is any indication of official favor, Steffen Seibert, the chancellor\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cFrom the first day, the German government has made it clear that Mr. Navalny was here in   on humanitarian reasons,\u201d Mr. Seibert said. But the public and official attention surrounding Mr. Navalny\u2019s arrival and treatment in Germany after his poisoning has raised this question: Will Berlin now take a tougher stance against Moscow amid  \u201cOf course, one always thinks that a new low point in German-Russian relations has been reached, then it gets even worse, and the next thing happens,\u201d said Dr. Stefan Meister, head of the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation\u2019s South Caucasus Office. \u201cWith every point the pressure grows, also from the public, for the German government to harden its stance toward Russia.\u201d Still, experts are skeptical that either Berlin or the European Union has the political will to take concrete action, or to unite split interests, that would send a clear message to Russia. Russia has maintained that it played no role in  ; last week the foreign ministry in Moscow accused Germany of dramatizing the episode. German and other European experts, though, say Mr. Navalny was attacked with a military-grade chemical from the Novichok group, a Soviet-designed chemical weapon. Use of the substance would be a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention to which Moscow is a signatory, raising the prospect that Germany could lead the European Union to enact painful sanctions against Moscow. The watchdog for that convention, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, is expected to release in the coming days the results of its own analysis of biomedical samples collected from Mr. Navalny by its team of experts, the agency said last week. But Mr. Meister said he does not see the E.U.\u2019s 27 members finding a consensus to enact sanctions. That is especially so, he said, after the   to impose economic sanctions on the leader of Belarus,  , after the fraudulent election in that country, crackdown on opposition leaders, and beatings and arrests of peaceful protesters. \u201cThe political will to take a harder stance against Russia is absent,\u201d Mr. Meister said of the European Union. He added that Berlin\u2019s own policy toward Moscow remained \u201cstuck in its internal contradictions and compromises.\u201d Nevertheless, over the past six years, since the Russians sent soldiers without insignia \u2014 the   \u2014 into Crimea, Berlin\u2019s position toward Moscow has shifted gradually, said Gustav C. Gressel, a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. The pro-Russia stance that for decades has been the trademark of the center-left Social Democrats \u2014 currently junior partners in Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing coalition \u2014 has been chipped away at by Moscow\u2019s increasingly bold steps toward Berlin. These include carrying out   in 2015, and the   in a Berlin park last year. \u201cAll of those who call for appeasement, insisting that we have to respect Russia, are becoming less popular,\u201d Mr. Gressel said, and increasingly, it is the hard-liners against Russia who are being heard. That does not translate into immediate action on Germany\u2019s part, however. Early calls to cancel the nearly completed, $11 billion  from Russia to Germany have faded, and Ms. Merkel\u2019s government has insisted it will seek a European response to the poisoning. But from the outset Ms. Merkel has taken an unusually personal interest in Mr. Navalny\u2019s fate. She granted him swift entry to Germany even though most Russians are barred, given the threat of the coronavirus, and personally announced in notably harsh terms the discovery that Novichok had turned up in the tests on Mr. Navalny \u2014 which the chancellor in  Speaking to reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron of France echoed the chancellor\u2019s demand for Russia to explain what had happened to Mr. Navalny before a meeting of the European Council, part of the European Union\u2019s executive arm, on Thursday and Friday. The poisoning has been added to that meeting\u2019s agenda. \u201cThis is very clearly a murder attempt carried out on Russian soil, against a Russian opposition leader with a chemical agent manipulated in Russia,\u201d Mr. Macron told the reporters, according to Reuters. \u201cIt is therefore up to Russia to provide clarifications.\u201d  \u2014 which sanctions those found to be in violation of human rights \u2014 would give the bloc an additional tool to use against Moscow in Mr. Navalny\u2019s case. But even if Europe does pull together its own version, Mr. Meister expects that those affected would be limited largely to individuals who do not regularly conduct business outside of Russia. The bigger question, though, will be how Russia decides to treat Mr. Navalny once he returns home as he has said he plans to do, said Janis Kluge, an analyst for Eastern Europe with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. President Vladimir V. Putin has   in 20 years of speeches and interviews. But Mr. Navalny has now met with the German chancellor, whether officially or otherwise, and his poisoning has become the focus of an investigation by an international institution to which Russia is a signatory member. \u201cIt\u2019s about how Moscow now deals with the case, much more than about Mr. Navalny himself,\u201d Mr. Kluge said. \u201cRussia could have at least launched an investigation into what happened to him, but the fact that they haven\u2019t done so yet shows how little Moscow really cares that Europe and Germany are shocked.\u201d "},
{"text": "Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who took refuge in Lithuania, is \u2018wanted on a criminal charge\u2019, Russian interior ministry says. Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has been placed on Russia\u2019s wanted list, the country\u2019s interior ministry has said. The 38-year-old, who took refuge in European Union member Lithuania following her claim to have beaten long-running leader Alexander Lukashenko in August elections, is \u201cwanted on a criminal charge,\u201d the Russian interior ministry told AFP on Wednesday. The Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that Tikhanovskaya faces a charge in Belarus of making public calls to harm the country\u2019s security, including calls to seize power. Russian news agencies cited law enforcement sources as saying that her listing appeared automatically due to Moscow\u2019s commitments as part of a \u201cunion state\u201d with neighbouring Belarus. Belarus has not announced Tikhanovskaya as wanted, however. Belarusian interior ministry spokeswoman Olga Chemodanova told the country\u2019s Tut.by independent news site, \u201cSo far, I don\u2019t have information that I could tell you.\u201d Tikhanovskaya\u2019s campaign office told the Russian Interfax news agency: \u201cWe don\u2019t know about this. Svetlana did not receive any messages. But this is actually of little interest [to us].\u201d Numerous key allies of Tikhanovskaya have been detained on the charge of making public calls to harm the country\u2019s security or driven out of the country by threats from the authorities. Huge crowds have gathered for protests every weekend in Belarus since the elections, despite harsh police tactics including the use of tear gas and water cannon, supporting Tikhanovskaya\u2019s call for new elections to be held according to international standards. A political novice until her campaign to end Lukashenko\u2019s 26-year rule brought thousands out onto the streets of Belarus, Tikhanovskaya has recently met European leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, she said it was not up to Putin to decide the fate of her country but added that she would welcome his involvement in mediating the political crisis. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to say that Putin has to decide how to solve our problems. This is our internal problem,\u201d she told reporters in the German parliament\u2019s lower house, the Bundestag. \u201cWe want to invite him to be a mediator,\u201d she said in English. Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday the Russian leader, who has strongly backed Lukashenko, had no plans to meet her. \u201cNo contacts are being planned,\u201d Peskov told reporters. \u201cTikhanovskaya is not in Belarus. One can hardly say that she is somehow involved in Belarus\u2019s life. \u201cShe is meeting with various heads of state and government who consider Belarus\u2019s sitting president illegitimate.\u201d The EU and the United States have refused to recognise Lukashenko\u2019s inauguration as president last month, citing rigged polls. EU leaders have approved sanctions against Belarus officials but not against Lukashenko himself, prompting Belarus to announce counter-sanctions against unnamed officials. Tikhanovskaya, an English teacher by training, is campaigning against Lukashenko despite the Belarusian authorities holding her husband Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular opposition blogger, in prison in pre-trial detention. She sent the couple\u2019s two young children abroad before her own departure. "},
{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The head of Russia\u2019s space agency said that the lunar Gateway, part of NASA\u2019s Artemis lunar exploration program, is too \u201cU.S.-centric\u201d for it to participate in, even though the Gateway leverages the existing International Space Station partnership. During a panel featuring the heads of seven space agencies at the International Astronautical Congress Oct. 12, Dmitry Rogozin, director general of Roscosmos, said it was unlikely that his agency would play a major role in the Gateway despite the planned participation of other ISS partners, including Canada, Europe and Japan. \u201cIn our view, the lunar Gateway in its current form is too U.S.-centric, so to speak,\u201d Rogozin said through an interpreter. \u201cRussia is likely to refrain from participating in it on a large scale.\u201d During a later press conference, Rogozin elaborated on his issues with the Gateway. \u201cThe most important thing here would be to base this program on the principles of international cooperation which were used in order to fly the ISS program,\u201d he said, such as collective decision-making among the station\u2019s partners.  \u201cIf we could get back to considering making these principles as the foundation of the program, then Roscosmos could also consider its participation,\u201d he said of the Gateway. Rogozin\u2019s comments about seeking to use the ISS as a model for the lunar Gateway are surprising since that is already NASA\u2019s approach for developing it. NASA previously announced it would extend the existing intergovernmental agreement, or IGA, for the space station for the Gateway, even as it seeks a new set of agreements, called the Artemis Accords, for the broader Artemis program. \u201cThe Gateway uses the intergovernmental agreement established for the International Space Station,\u201d NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in an interview after the conference session. \u201cAll of the protocols that exist on the International Space Station would also exist for the Gateway, so I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a challenge.\u201d NASA has been working with each ISS partner on memorandums of understanding (MOU) that would extend that ISS agreement for use on the Gateway. Bridenstine said that, in February, NASA asked Roscosmos for comments on how a potential MOU between the two agencies would work. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting to hear back from them,\u201d he said. Rogozin said that even if Russia does not decide to participate in the Gateway, he wanted to ensure that it used standard docking interfaces so that Russian spacecraft could dock with it. \u201cWe need to have at least two space transportation systems,\u201d he said, referring to Russian plans for a next-generation crewed spacecraft called Orel. Standards for docking would enable Orel to dock with the Gateway \u201ceven if we pursue two standalone programs.\u201d NASA is already pursuing such standards, Bridenstine said. \u201cWe are in broad agreement with Roscosmos that we need international standards for interoperability,\u201d he said, including not just docking but other areas, from communications to life support systems. Interoperability, he noted, is one of the principles of the Artemis Accords. He also supported development of a Russian transportation system that could deliver crews to the Gateway. \u201cIf we have dissimilar redundancy for transportation to the Gateway, and ultimately to the moon, that\u2019s very positive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very supportive of that.\u201d \u201cWhat the Artemis Accords are really about is coming up with those foundational principles that we all agree on so that when we go explore these worlds together, there\u2019s commonality,\u201d Bridenstine said at the press conference. \u201cThe whole purpose of it is to prevent misperceptions.\u201d 2020 Spacenews, Inc.

{"text": "Russia's top prosecutor paid a visit Friday to parts of the Moscow-controlled, Tokyo-claimed islands off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido, islanders said. Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov is the first senior Russian government official to visit the disputed islands, called the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kurils in Russia, since Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga took office last month. The rare visit by Moscow's top investigative official to Kunashiri and Shikotan islands is expected to draw backlash from Tokyo. In August, Russian emergencies minister Yevgeny Zinichev also traveled to Kunashiri Island. Krasnov held talks with local prosecutors and residents on the two islands, while arrangements are being made for a visit to Etorofu Island, according to sources close to the matter. As part of his trip to the country's Far East, Krasnov on Thursday visited Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the capital of the Sakhalin region, which has jurisdiction over the island group, becoming the first top prosecutor to do so in 20 years. He offered flowers to a monument dedicated to former Soviet soldiers who died in operations on the Kuril Islands, which were under Japan's control until the final stages of World War II in August 1945, and elsewhere. The decades-long dispute over the island chain that also includes the Habomai islet group has prevented the two countries from signing a postwar peace treaty. The four islands were seized by the Soviet Union following Japan's surrender in 1945. Tokyo argues the annexation was illegal and demands their return, while Moscow says it was a legitimate outcome of the war. Suga has expressed his readiness to promote negotiations on the territorial dispute, which his predecessor Shinzo Abe failed to put an end to, based on a 1956 joint declaration between Japan and the Soviet Union. In 2018, Abe and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to advance negotiations based on the declaration stipulating that Moscow will hand over the two smaller islands \u2014 Shikotan and Habomai \u2014 to Tokyo after a peace treaty is concluded. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPandemic biggest hurdle for New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern after 'tectonic' election\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoronavirus survives on skin five times longer than flu, Japan study finds\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSuga's fertility push hailed, but not panacea for boosting birth rate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChina's millennials stimulate $15 billion sex toy market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirus spikes collide with fatigue and apathy in troubling trend\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tEpisode 68: Naomi Osaka \u2014 seven matches, seven masks, seven names\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tDirectory of who\u2019s who in the world of business in Japan\n\t\t\t Sponsored contents planned and edited by JT Media Enterprise Division.

The Pistons are allowing their arena to be used as a polling station. National security officials say the Kremlin is at it again: Just like in 2016, Russia is using social media to try to undermine the U.S. presidential election, only with even more sophisticated tools. But this time around, Russia may not have to try so hard. Social media companies and outside experts say in 2020, the biggest threats to the election may be coming from Americans in the form of possible violence, mistruths about mail-in balloting, and misinformation in the wake of possibly delayed election results \u2014 not to mention a president who has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the vote. \"In some ways, the people who know the most about how to mislead Americans are other Americans,\" said Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity. NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre and NPR technology correspondent Shannon Bond break down some of the key questions:  National security officials and analysts who study this are absolutely clear: Russia is the main foreign threat, and by a long shot. China and Iran are also trying to influence the election but at a much lower level. The Russians have been attempting to interfere for many years, and their approach keeps evolving. Last time, they hacked into Democratic Party emails and also used automated fake accounts on social media, said  , of the Wilson Center and the author of  \"Russia has pivoted to information laundering, that is planting a narrative with an influential individual who can then amplify that narrative,\" she said. In one instance, the Russians created   and paid freelance American journalists to write stories. The Americans didn't know who they were working for. But this was small stuff. There's no evidence so far of a foreign campaign gaining major traction. The U.S. intelligence community is much better prepared for this election, said  , author of the new book  The CIA and the National Security Agency can legally monitor and take action against a foreign group or individual spreading disinformation. But in the U.S., free speech protections normally prevent that kind of action. \"For some agencies, like the CIA, it's illegal to operate domestically. And for the FBI, it is politically a very hot potato, a very problematic thing to be countering domestic disinformation because it is so political,\" said Rid. Security experts are warning that the atmosphere is ripe for disinformation, and there are a lot of false claims and rumors already circulating. That includes \"everything from Qanon [a baseless conspiracy theory] to mobilizations to protest, COVID-19 conspiracies and then ultimately mail-in ballots and voter fraud,\" said Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent who tracks online security threats at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Researchers and social media platforms say bad actors are capitalizing on the uncertainty created by the pandemic to confuse people about how to vote, undermine confidence in the election results and even threaten violence. In some cases, they say, would-be foreign meddlers need only amplify falsehoods being spread by U.S. social media users. \"Russia doesn't have to make fake news. They just repeat what conspiracies are coming out of the White House and the administration,\" Watts said. Election watchers are particularly concerned about efforts to undermine confidence in voting   as President Trump has done repeatedly, with his tweets and Facebook posts claiming, falsely, that mail-in ballots are vulnerable to fraud. Facebook and Twitter have both tightened rules against voting misinformation, casting doubt on the election results and premature claims of victory before results are final. In Twitter's case, Roth said its most recent   were \"specifically in recognition of some of the recent threats that we've seen emerge around attempts to undermine public confidence in voting techniques like voting by mail.\" The companies meet monthly, along with government and law enforcement agencies, to discuss threats and their responses. Facebook and Twitter both say they are prepared to take measures to crack down on content that presents a threat of real-world harm, like violence or voter suppression. Twitter frequently applies fact-checking labels to President Trump's posts about voting, and Facebook has begun to do the same. That has given fodder to Republican critics of the companies, however, who have long claimed, without clear evidence, that tech platforms are biased against conservatives. But even as the social media giants are to be taking the threat of disinformation   and especially foreign influence   more seriously than they did four years ago, critics say they are still too slow. In many cases, posts that break the rules are labeled or removed only after they have spread widely. Critics say it's not just about whether the platforms set the right rules   it's about how they enforce those rules. This week, former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign   for not removing Trump's false claims about voting. \"By now Mr. Trump clearly understands that Facebook will not hold him to their clearly stated policies,\" the campaign wrote in a letter to Facebook obtained by Axios. A Facebook spokesman says the company applies its rules \"impartially.\" The Trump administration is sending very mixed messages, Jankowicz said. \"On the one hand, we see these stark warnings coming from the U.S. intelligence agencies. And on the other hand, President Trump is joking about fake news with [Russian leader] Vladimir Putin,\" she said. Trump has declared repeatedly at campaign events that widespread mail-in balloting will lead to \"the most corrupt election in the history of our country.\" In contrast, FBI Director Christopher Wray, along with many other national security and election officials, are offering assurances that election systems have been hardened and that it will be extremely difficult to tamper with actual votes, in-person or by mail. Facebook and Twitter are sounding the alarm over potential \"hack and leak\" operations like we saw in 2016. Just last week, the companies took down   they said were involved in the leak of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign four years ago. The risk of disinformation and manipulation does not end on Election Day. The big question is: What will the platforms do to stop bad information from spreading in an information vacuum, if it takes days or even weeks for final election results? \"This is probably going to take a little bit longer to do the counting because of the increase in absentee ballots,\"  , director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said recently. \"Have a little bit of patience.\" "},

{"text": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said he is recovering his verbal and physical abilities at the German hospital where he is being treated for suspected nerve agent poisoning but that he at first felt despair over his condition.  Navalny, the most visible opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on a domestic flight to Moscow on Aug. 20 and was transferred to Germany for treatment two days later. A German military lab later determined that the Russian politician was poisoned with Novichok, the same class of Soviet-era agent that Britain said was used on a former Russian spy and his daughter in England, in 2018.  Navalny was kept in an induced coma for more than a week while being treated with an antidote. He said in a Saturday post on Instagram that once he was brought out of the coma, he was confused and couldn\u2019t find the words to respond to a doctor\u2019s questions.  \u201cAlthough I understood in general what the doctor wanted, I did not understand where to get the words. In what part of the head do they appear in?\u201d Navalny wrote in the post, which accompanied a photo of him on a staircase. \u201cI also did not know how to express my despair and, therefore, simply kept silent.\u201d \u201cNow I\u2019m a guy whose legs are shaking when he walks up the stairs, but he thinks: \u2018Oh, this is a staircase! They go up it. Perhaps we should look for an elevator,\u2019\u201d Navalny said. \u201dAnd before, I would have just stood there and stared.\u201d The doctors treating him at Berlin\u2019s Charite hospital \u201cturned me from a \u2018technically alive person\u2019 into someone who has every chance to become the Highest Form of Being in Modern Society again \u2014 a person who can quickly scroll through Instagram and without hesitation understands where to put likes,\u201d he wrote. The Kremlin has repeatedly said that before Navalny\u2019s transfer to Berlin, Russian labs and a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk found no sign of a poisoning. Moscow has called for Germany to provide its evidence and bristled at the urging of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other Western leaders to answer questions about what happened to the politician. \u201cThere is too much absurdity in this case to take anyone at their word,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday. Peskov also accused Navalny\u2019s colleagues of hampering a Russian investigation by taking items from his hotel room out of the country, including a water bottle they claimed had traces of the nerve agent.  Navalny\u2019s colleagues said that they removed the bottle and other items from the hotel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk Siberia and brought them to Germany as potential evidence. because they didn\u2019t trust Russian authorities to conduct a proper probe.

It is no accident that Russia has named its vaccine Sputnik V, harking back to the Soviet satellite sent into orbit in 1957 amid fierce competition with the US. For Russia, providing the first solution to a pandemic that has affected every corner of the world would be seen as a confirmation that the country\u2019s scientific brains are still among the world\u2019s best. \u201cIt\u2019s like the space race half a century later. If indeed it\u2019s a success story and Russia is the first country to come up with an efficient vaccine then of course it\u2019s a major PR opportunity,\u201d said Andrey Kortunov, who runs the Russian International Affairs Council in Moscow. But first, Russia has to prove that Sputnik V, produced by the Gamaleya, part of the country\u2019s ministry of health, actually works. In early September, Gamaleya scientists   of phase one and two trials in the Lancet, and a phase three trial is now under way, which should involve 40,000 volunteers being vaccinated in the coming weeks. Even at this early stage, however, the government is pushing ahead with ambitious plans for a broad rollout across the country and beyond. While there is clearly one eye on global glory, producing a successful vaccine will also be welcome at home, given Russia has recorded the fourth-highest number of Covid cases in the world. A second wave is well under way, with the number of new cases rising dramatically in recent days. On Monday, Putin appealed to Russians to take \u201cmaximum responsibility\u201d for their behaviour and try to minimise the Covid risks. \u201cWe are already vaccinating high-risk groups in different regions of Russia, and we will go to about 10m doses a month in December,\u201d said Dmitriev, estimating that within seven to nine months, the majority of Russians will have been vaccinated. While the doses for Russians will be produced inside the country, Russia hopes to license production to a number of other countries, including India, and Dmitriev estimated that capacity could be 500m doses a year by next year. These numbers may be wildly unrealistic, but the confidence with which they are stated underlines the fact that Russian authorities have placed a huge bet on the vaccine being a success story. Numerous vaccines are in advanced clinical trials across the world, but the Gamaleya vaccine is the only one that already has large-scale rollout plans. The vaccine uses two human adenoviruses engineered with a coronavirus gene, and comes in two shots taken 21 days apart. On Wednesday, Russia\u2019s consumer safety watchdog said the Vector institute in Siberia had completed clinical trials of a second potential vaccine. Gamaleya scientists believe that immunity from its double-shot vaccine should last for two years, though Dmitriev conceded that \u201conly time will tell\u201d. Some of the critics of the speed of the rollout have said that while the vaccine itself may be safe, if it offers minimal or only brief immune responses it may have a counterproductive effect and lower confidence in vaccines in general. Other scientists have been more positive. \u201cThe risks associated with this class of vaccine are not great, and I think it\u2019s likely they will provide a level of immunity that\u2019s useful,\u201d said Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading. Numerous top Russian officials took the vaccine over the summer, even before it had been approved for use, as did one of Putin\u2019s daughters. \u201cI had a temperature for one day, took some paracetamol, and then I was fine. Now I can see that I have antibodies,\u201d said one member of the Russian political elite who was vaccinated back in June. Still, some feel uneasy about  . One official said the issue had become \u201cso politicised\u201d it was better not to talk about it or raise potential risks in official meetings. It is not just Russia that has seen vaccine development as a race. In Tuesday\u2019s  , Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to rush through a vaccine. \u201cHe puts pressure, and disagrees with his own scientists,\u201d said Joe Biden, in response to Trump saying a vaccine would be ready \u201cvery soon\u201d. A moment of truth for the Russian vaccine will be the results of the phase three trials. According to the ministry of health, as of last Friday 3,500 people had taken part in the trial, and all 40,000 should have received their first shot by the end of October. One quarter of participants will receive a placebo, to compare Covid infection rates among the two groups. Participants in the trial will have to upload health data into an app for a six-month period. Officials say the trial is oversubscribed, but there are signs that not everyone is participating voluntarily. One employee of a Moscow government department described pressure at work to sign up. \u201cIt was made clear that we had to sign up online for the trial. When they called to tell me to come for an appointment, I had to make up an excuse as to why I couldn\u2019t,\u201d said the employee. A journalist for the Russian outlet Meduza, who volunteered for the vaccine, reported that when she arrived at the vaccination point a man was complaining he had been forced to attend. The ministry of health and Gamaleya declined to answer questions from the Guardian, initially promising an interview but then offering instead a short written response to questions, stating that the vaccine \u201chas proved its safety and efficiency\u201d. Russia is so confident that Sputnik V will be successful that it will not seek full indemnity from purchasers, leaving the state open to huge compensation claims if major side-effects are discovered later. Dmitriev claimed he had already received provisional orders for more than 1.2bn doses of the vaccine for the next year from more than 50 countries. \u201cThe west will unfortunately, for political reasons, continue to paint it black and undermine, and that is just the unfortunate reality of the world,\u201d he said.

{"text": "Moscow\u2019s operatives did not invent our crude tribal politics; they just exploited them. Ms. Hill was senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council from 2017 to 2019. Robert O\u2019Brien, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser,  that he had recently met his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, in Geneva and warned him that \u201cthere would be absolutely no tolerance for any interference\u201d in the November election. This was a pointless exchange. It misrepresents how Russia actually interferes in our affairs. The Russian state does not meddle directly. It delegates to proxies, who amplify our divisions and exploit our political polarization. And the truth is, Americans must recognize that the United States is ripe for manipulation. With a month to go before Election Day, we are ripping ourselves apart. When I was at the National Security Council, I had similar meetings with Mr. Patrushev and other Russian officials; we met in Geneva, in Moscow and in side rooms at international summits. With the national security advisers H.R. McMaster and John Bolton, we called them out for intervening in our 2016 elections. We warned them not to repeat their operations in 2018 and 2020. Our Russian counterparts never admitted to anything. They professed surprise at the uproar in American politics. They had done nothing. The United States, they said, had \u201cgone mad.\u201d The uproar, we countered, was their fault. They had lost the entire American political class. Their actions pushed our bilateral relationship into a destructive spiral. We would then run through the now widely reported facts about what Russian operatives had done. Russia\u2019s 2016 campaign was a creative mix of old-style propaganda techniques and new cybertools. On the one hand, Russia state-backed media outlets magnified the most divisive U.S. political conflicts. On the other, Twitter bots and WikiLeaks spread disinformation and revealed hacked emails. Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency analyzed U.S. public opinion and hired individuals to pose as Americans on Facebook. how could these actions \u2014 hypothetical, of course possibly have had such an impact? Apart from the use of cyberhacks and social media, what we were describing was a textbook \u201cactive measures\u201d operation. Everyone used to do this in the Cold War. What was the big deal? Was the United States really so vulnerable? Could America be so fractured and fragile that one \u201cbad election\u201d would plunge it into political chaos? In fact, the United States was vulnerable in 2016. The Russian operation was sophisticated and audacious, but it took advantage of our mistakes and what Americans did to fellow Americans. Russian operatives did not invent our crude tribal politics; they invented internet personas to whip them up. American politicians reduced the country to red and blue states; Russian operatives purchased online ads to target voters on both sides of the domestic divide. American commentators pinned vitriolic labels on our national leaders; Russian bots spread the offensive comments around. I stressed in one side meeting that the Russian security services had taken things to a new level of dirty tricks. Their \u201chack and release\u201d of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s emails and efforts to penetrate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails were especially damaging. With an arch of the eyebrow, the Russian interlocutor pointed out that no Russian persuaded Mrs. Clinton to use a private server. She and the Democratic National Committee made themselves vulnerable to hackers by not taking proper precautions. He reminded me that it was the F.B.I. that reopened the investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails just before the election, because they were on Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer when he was arrested. \u201cWe didn\u2019t invent Anthony Weiner,\u201d he retorted. He brushed off my further protests and objections at his cynicism. \u201cPerhaps you should direct your complaints elsewhere.\u201d Moscow, like everyone else, expected Mrs. Clinton to win in 2016. Russian operatives wanted to weaken her, but they were surprised \u2014 and delighted \u2014 when she lost. They were even more delighted when many Americans exaggerated their role in the outcome. Some of my own foreign policy colleagues suggested the Russians had changed opinions on a mass scale as well as affected votes on the margins. American politicians and commentators declared President Trump illegitimate. They said Vladimir Putin \u201celected\u201d him. Truth is, the idea that Russia determined the election is overstated. It would never have resonated so loudly without our deep polarization \u2014 and our structural issues, including the vast discrepancy between the popular vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton and the narrow Electoral College win for Mr. Trump. These issues were rooted in our system and had already played out in 2000. By overplaying Russia\u2019s ability to influence the vote, American politicians and pundits conceded victory to Russia and its intelligence agencies. Instead, we should have focused on fixing our own faults. Today, we are even more fractured than in 2016. What was then a vulnerability is now a full-blown national security crisis. Our partisan strife has contributed to the botched handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has eroded our international reputation. It has made us susceptible to manipulation by any foreign or nonstate actor that wants to weaken us. Our own political actors are undermining our democracy in a gambit to sway the election. The United States has set international standards for free and fair elections for decades. But President Trump, not President Putin, has repeatedly declared our electoral system \u201crigged\u201d and questioned the integrity of the ballot. As I came to realize while I was at the National Security Council, working directly with colleagues from the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies, the structure of our electoral system is complex and decentralized. Since 2016, the federal government has worked with state and local government officials as well as tech companies to harden our critical infrastructure. Early voting, online voting, in-person voting and paper and mail-in ballots all increase physical election security. If there is full voter turnout, and every vote is counted in every form, then it is much more difficult for anyone \u2014 domestic or foreign \u2014 to mess with the margins. If we want to restore our democracy, we need to heal our divisions and get out the vote. The biggest risk to this election is not the Russians, it\u2019s us. Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at Brookings, was deputy assistant to the president and senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council from 2017 to 2019. "},
{"text": "The Arctic has gone through its warmest summer on record, and with the ice melting, more ships than ever are sailing along Russia\u2019s Siberian coast, underscoring its role as a growing energy transport corridor and potential as a new ocean trade route. The Northern Sea Route, which runs from Alaska to the Baltic Sea, counted 71 vessels and 935 sailings across the waterway from January to June this year, according to the NSR information office. That was up by double digits from the same period a year ago and a big increase from the 47 vessels and 572 voyages in the same period of 2018. The mostly frozen seaway is used in warmer seasons to move some of Russia\u2019s energy exports to overseas markets. Container ships and general cargo vessel operators also have used the route to move goods between Asia and Europe as it cuts an average 10 days of sailing time compared with the standard route through the Suez Canal. Freight transport on the NSR is at its highest from July to November. Some sailings also take place in the rest of the year, and the Russian government expects largely ice-free year-round trips starting in 2024. \u201cThere are many more ships because the ice is thin and you can sail without the help of icebreakers,\u201d said Arne O. Holm, editor in chief of the Norway-based\u00a0High North News, which monitors the NSR. \u201cThe NSR needs a lot of investment to attract bigger cargo vessels, but activity is picking up, and if the ice keeps melting it will be another option to move cargo from northern China to Europe.\u201d  Top news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology.  The National Snow and Ice Data Center, a private science research group supported by U.S. government agencies, said in September that this summer was the warmest on record in the Arctic, with the extent of sea ice across the entire Arctic shrinking to 3.74 million square kilometers, or 1.44 million square miles. That\u2019s not much more than half the average ice cover of 6.7 million square kilometers measured from 1979 to 2000. \u201cThere was no ice at all across the coastline in September, no need for icebreakers or ice-hardened vessels,\u201d said Nikos Papalios, a mechanic on a crude tanker that sails the NSR. \u201cIt stayed above freezing for 10 days, from the port of Sabetta to the Bering Strait, and it was pleasant to sit on the deck. It felt out of place,\u201d Mr. Papalios said. Most vessels operating in the NSR are natural gas carriers and oil tankers carrying exports to European and Asian customers from Novatek\u2019s Yamal liquefied natural gas project and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n      Novy Port crude oil project at the Yamal Peninsula along Russia\u2019s northern coast. These heavily reinforced ships are built to move through ice-filled waters and can cost more than $200 million each, more than twice the price of similar-size ocean vessels. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the NSR will be key to develop the Arctic and become a global transport route. The Russian government expects cargo volumes across the waterway will reach 32 million metric tons this year, up 78% from 18 million metric tons in 2018. Novatek expects to ship about 52 million metric tons of LNG a year by 2030. Brokers said container ships and bulk carriers operated by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n      Ltd., Nordic Bulk Carriers A/S and Norway-headquartered Golden Ocean Group are  . Denmark\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n      the world\u2019s biggest container ship operator, sent a 3,600-container ship from Vladivostok in the Russian Far East to St. Petersburg in late 2018 laden with frozen fish to explore the NSR\u2019s potential. But there are limits to the waterway\u2019s potential role in global trade. Cargo between Asia and Europe is handled by massive ships that can carry more than 20,000 containers each. Parts of the NSR are too shallow for anything larger than a 5,000-container vessel and there are no transshipment ports. Early hopes of big Chinese infrastructure investments also are fading. State-owned transport giants like Cosco and China Merchants Holdings Ltd. are pouring billions into linking ports with roads and rail to connect Asia and Europe under the Belt and Road Initiative rather than step up investments in the Northern Sea Route. French container ship major CMA CGM SA and German counterpart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n      have said they won\u2019t send ships on the NSR, citing concerns over the environmental protections. \u201cThe NSR is growing and it\u2019s good if you want to move boxes quickly at a single destination port. But it\u2019s not going to replace the Suez Canal,\u201d a senior Cosco official said. \n\t\t\n\tArne O. Holm is editor in chief of the Norway-based High North News.

{"text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Plans for Russia\u2019s biggest corporate deal of 2020 collapsed on Friday after talks over a $5.48 billion cash-and-share sale of online bank Tinkoff to internet giant Yandex ended. Discussions over the potential tie-up, which would have increased competition for Russia\u2019s largest lender Sberbank and smaller rivals in technology and banking, stalled less than four weeks after they were announced by Tinkoff parent TCS Group Holding. TCS said in a statement it had agreed with Yandex not to proceed with the transaction, but Tinkoff would continue to partner with it on existing and future projects. \u201cToday I decided to break the possible deal with Yandex,\u201d TCS founder Oleg Tinkov said in an internal email which was seen by Reuters on Friday. Tinkov, a major TCS shareholder, could not be reached for comment and the online bank\u2019s press office declined to comment. Yandex shares fell 2.2% in Moscow to 4,652.0 roubles ($59.64) at 1451 GMT, while TCS Group\u2019s London-listed shares were 1.3% lower, after earlier hitting a three-month low. TCS and Yandex announced they were in talks on Sept. 22, a few months after Yandex said it was ending its partnership with Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest lender. Tinkov said in his email that Yandex was interested only in a takeover of Tinkoff, the world\u2019s largest fully online bank with more than 10 million customers across Russia, whereas Tinkov viewed the deal as a merger. Yandex had agreed that Tinkov would be involved in managing the bank and help Yandex in general after the deal, Tigran Khudaverdyan, Yandex\u2019s deputy CEO, said in a post on his corporate blog, confirmed as genuine by its press department. Khudaverdyan said Tinkov had made more demands after each stage of talks and his decision did not come as a surprise. Tinkov had previously played down talk of an acquisition, insisting the deal being discussed with Yandex was not a sale but a merger. \u201cTinkoff is not for sale, neither to Yandex, nor MTS,\u201d Tinkov said, referring to reports that TCS was in discussions to sell the bank to Russia\u2019s top mobile operator MTS.

{"text": "With an eye to a possible Biden presidency, the Russian leader called for a \u201creboot\u201d on information security but offered no concessions. MOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday proposed a truce with the United States in cyberspace, without acknowledging that his country has repeatedly used cybertechniques to attack elections from the Ukraine to the United States, stolen emails from the Defense Department to the White House, and developed some of the world\u2019s most sophisticated disinformation efforts. Mr. Putin issued an unusual   outlining a four-point plan for what he called a \u201creboot\u201d in the relationship between the United States and Russia in the field of information security. Moscow and Washington, he wrote, should issue \u201cguarantees of nonintervention into the internal affairs of each other, including into electoral processes.\u201d He urged a bilateral agreement \u201con preventing incidents in the information space,\u201d modeled on Cold War-era arms control treaties. But beyond the conciliatory language, Mr. Putin\u2019s statement offered no hint that Moscow was prepared to make any specific concessions on its greatly accelerated use of cyberweapons over the past decade \u2014 sometimes directly, sometimes through proxies. Russia continues to deny interfering in American politics, while insisting that the United States meddles in Russian politics by backing opponents of Mr. Putin. \u201cAs we have said more than once, there is no basis\u201d for claims that Russia has meddled in American elections, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov,   on Friday. \u201cWe are in favor of a professional and constructive discussion of all existing problems and claims at the negotiating table.\u201d President Trump has said repeatedly that he is tempted to believe Mr. Putin\u2019s insistence that Russia had no role in the 2016 election, although the spokesman for the National Security Council, John Ullyot, dismissed Mr. Putin\u2019s offer on Friday. \u201cIt is hard to take such statements seriously when Russia, China, Iran and others have sought to undermine our election process,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ullyot said, following Mr. Trump in suggesting the problem goes beyond Russia. \u201cIt is possible that this offer is a further effort by Russia to create divisions in the United States,\u2019\u2019 he said. Russia has floated similar proposals before, including when Mr. Putin met with President Trump in Helsinki, Finland, in 2018. Mr. Trump warmed to them at first, saying he would work with Russia to create \u201can impenetrable cybersecurity unit\u201d designed to assure \u201cthat election hacking, and many other negative things, will be guarded and safe.\u201d But Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration was mocked by many, including some members of the president\u2019s own staff, who asked how the United States would jointly patrol cyberspace with one of the world\u2019s leaders in cyberespionage. At around the same time, the United States was placing malware inside Russia\u2019s electric grid , in hopes of deterring Moscow from attacking the American grid. It was not clear if Mr. Putin was calling for the reset because of the intense focus on Russian activity around the 2020 election, or because firms  attacks, some from groups linked to the military and Russian intelligence agencies. This time, Mr. Putin is calling for a reset less than six weeks before an American presidential election that could put an outspoken critic of the Kremlin \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 in the White House. The move appeared at least in part to be an attempt to present a friendlier face in response to American officials\u2019 recent statements that Russia had mounted clandestine efforts to weaken Mr. Biden in the presidential race. Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., warned last week   against Mr. Biden. That led to a rebuke of Mr. Wray from Mr. Trump. And a recent C.I.A. analysis   that it was likely Mr. Putin was continuing to approve and direct   operations aimed at raising Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election chances. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that in the Kremlin they understand that Biden is likely to win,\u201d said Andrei Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a research organization close to the Russian government. \u201cThey are preparing for a Democratic administration that could be even tougher toward Russia than a Republican one.\u201d Both Russia and China have periodically proposed cybersecurity treaties, including requirements that everyone logging into the internet be required to use their true identity. While such proposals might limit illicit activity \u2014 if they could be enforced \u2014 they would also make it easier for the world\u2019s autocrats to hunt down dissidents. Most academic experts have concluded that the treaties that led to arms reductions from the 1960s forward were unlikely to work in cyberspace.   were in the hands of a small number of states; cyberweapons are controlled by countries, criminal groups, activists and teenagers. Often, states conduct their cyberactivities through proxies, including criminal groups. All those would make treaties fairly useless. Nonetheless Mr. Putin seemed enthralled by the idea. \u201cThese measures are aimed at building up trust between our States, promoting security and prosperity of our peoples,\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s statement said. \u201cThey will significantly contribute to ensuring global peace in the information space.\u201d Two Russian political analysts with ties to the Kremlin said in interviews Friday that even if Mr. Putin\u2019s proposal was a genuine attempt at improving the relationship with Washington, they did not expect it to go anywhere. Mr. Kortunov said Mr. Putin had not signaled that he was ready to give any substantial ground in the dispute over election interference. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the Kremlin would, of course, prefer not to quarrel with Washington, no matter the election result,\u201d Mr. Kortunov said, noting the risk of a President Biden seeking to impose new sanctions on Russia. \u201cBut they would like to avoid these challenges without paying a serious price.\u201d For instance, Mr. Kortunov noted, the Kremlin has not made any public effort to rein in  , the Russian business magnate indicted by the United States for helping spearhead interference in the 2016 election. On the contrary, Russia\u2019s relationship with the West has only deteriorated further in recent weeks. The  , the Russian opposition leader now recovering in Berlin, stirred revulsion in European countries including Germany and France \u2014 places where Mr. Putin had been able to count on some measure of sympathy. And Mr. Putin\u2019s  , the Belarusian autocrat who launched a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters last month, demonstrated the Kremlin\u2019s hard-line pursuit of a post-Soviet sphere of influence at the expense of human rights. Fyodor Lukyanov, a Moscow foreign-policy analyst who advises the Kremlin, said Friday\u2019s cybersecurity proposal underscored that Mr. Putin is now in a far more conciliatory mood than he was at the height of the Ukraine crisis five years ago. But he said American distrust of Russia was so deep that he did not expect Mr. Putin\u2019s proposal to be taken seriously in Washington \u2014 and that relations could take another step downward if Mr. Biden wins the presidency. Anton Troianovski reported from Moscow, and David E. Sanger from Washington. "},
{"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In 2016, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman shared polling data with an associate suspected of ties to Russian intelligence. Another Trump associate sought inside information about Democratic emails stolen by Kremlin operatives. The candidate himself invited Russia to hunt for his opponent\u2019s emails, then tried to stifle investigators once he entered the White House. These were among the findings of the special-counsel investigation of ties between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. It produced a trove of damaging, or at least embarrassing, information about Trump. Yet in the 2020 campaign, Democrats are largely ignoring the Russia probe. It\u2019s Republicans who are making it a top campaign issue. Trump and his supporters have cast the investigation as a witch hunt. It\u2019s a refrain in Trump tweets and speeches and on conservative media. In the run-up to the election, Trump-appointed officials are ordering the declassification of documents that Trump hopes will boost his campaign. While some of the revelations from the steady drip of newly declassified documents are serious, they do not undercut the reasons the Russia probe was launched or its principal findings. An inspector general and a bipartisan Senate panel have both concluded that the probe was valid. A look at the Russia probe:   The FBI opened \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d on July 31, 2016, after learning a Trump campaign aide may have had advance knowledge that Russian intelligence operatives had stolen Democratic emails. A diplomat revealed that the aide, George Papadopoulos, had boasted to him that he had heard Russia had damaging information on Democrat Hillary Clinton that it could release to harm her campaign. That May 2016 conversation triggered alarms within the FBI since the Russian hacking operation, which resulted in the public disclosure of thousands of hacked emails, was not yet public knowledge.   The investigation was taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller, whose team documented substantial contacts between Trump associates and Russia. That included a Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer that Trump\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took with the expectation of receiving dirt on Clinton, and a campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who shared internal polling data with a contact whom a  Senate Intelligence committee report  characterized as a Russian intelligence officer. A separate Justice Department inspector general report found the investigation was opened for a valid reason and did not find evidence of partisan bias. The Senate committee\u2019s report found Manafort\u2019s Russian contacts posed a \u201cgrave\u201d counterintelligence risk.   He was not criminally charged, but he wasn\u2019t vindicated.  It is true Mueller said his investigation did not find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump, or his associates, and Russia to sway the election. But the investigation also described broad Russian interference as well as a campaign that was eager to receive the help and expected to benefit from it.  Mueller also investigated multiple episodes in which he found Trump tried to exert control over the investigation, including by firing his FBI director, but Mueller did not push forward with obstruction of justice charges, citing Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president.   Most focus on one strand: the FBI\u2019s suspicion that former campaign adviser Carter Page was a Russian agent. Page has denied that and was not charged with any wrongdoing. The inspector general identified errors and omissions in applications the FBI submitted to a secretive court for permission to eavesdrop on Page. For instance, the FBI failed to update the court as it received new information that undercut its original premise about Page. It also highlighted how the warrant applications relied in part on Democratic-funded research conducted by former British spy Christopher Steele. The problems are significant because they suggest the FBI misused intrusive surveillance powers or withheld information from the court. The FBI was alerted that Russian disinformation could have made its way into the dossier of research, and a key source for Steele was himself once investigated by the FBI for possible connections to Russian intelligence, newly declassified documents show. Multiple former FBI and Justice Department officials have said they would not have certified the applications had they know then what they know now. FBI Director Chris Wray has issued more than 40 corrective steps to prevent the problems from recurring. But the Page aspect of the probe accounted for only a fraction of it, and the dossier \u2014 though the target of much derision \u2014 had nothing to do with the decision to open the investigation. The Page problems don\u2019t relate to the criminal convictions that Mueller\u2019s team produced against six Trump associates, or the 25 Russians indicted on charges related to election interference. In an extraordinary mix of politics in America\u2019s national-security apparatus, Trump has demanded that intelligence and Justice Department officials act to discredit the Russia investigation before the Nov. 3 election. To a large extent, they\u2019ve complied. Much of the declassified material involves Page and the dossier. But they\u2019ve also released information that, while creating buzz in conservative media, offer scant evidence of wrongdoing. Officials declassified the names of Obama administration officials who had requested the \u201cunmasking\u201d  of an American \u2014 in this case, former national-security adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 who surveillance revealed had interacted with Russia\u2019s ambassador, but who wasn\u2019t identified by name in intelligence reports. While Trump cast the unmasking as sinister, it\u2019s a routine action and proper procedures were followed.  The Washington Post reported Tuesday that a probe commissioned by Barr and focused on the \u201cunmasking\u201d question had concluded without criminal charges or any findings of substantive wrongdoing. Separately, some Republican senators are seeking an inspector general investigation after records showed multiple members of Mueller\u2019s team had forgotten their work phone passcodes or entered the wrong ones too often, causing data to be lost. One of the prosecutors, Andrew Weissmann, has said in media interviews that the issue is overblown since the information was backed up. More recently, the national intelligence director, John Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist, declassified what he said was Russian intelligence analysis even though he acknowledged the information might not be accurate. Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr has appointed a prosecutor to investigate the origins of the Russia probe. That prosecutor, U.S. Attorney John Durham of Connecticut, has secured a guilty plea from a former FBI lawyer for altering an email related to Page\u2019s surveillance. Trump has demanded big-name indictments and called for the probe to be  completed by Election Day. But it\u2019s become increasingly unclear when Durham will finish his work or what it will reveal, amid reports that no report is to be expected before Nov. 3. Before it was released, the Mueller report was seen as potentially devastating to Trump, with its details about campaign ties to Russia and the president\u2019s efforts to hinder the probe. Yet Democrats have hardly mentioned it. Leading in the polls, Democratic nominee Joe Biden has focused instead on Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the divisiveness of his presidency, issues that may be more likely to resonate with voters. Meanwhile, attacking the Russia probe is a core part of Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump and his supporters have often mischaracterized the investigation, with Trump falsely claiming that President Barack Obama spied on his campaign. Vice President Mike Pence falsely suggested at a debate last week that the investigation had vindicated Trump. Those attacks on the Russia probe may not win over undecided voters. But they could energize Trump\u2019s base at a time when the campaign needs a strong turnout in crucial battleground states. The FBI is investigating whether emails that were published by the New York Post related to Joe Biden's son, Hunter, are connected to a possible Russian influence operation to spread disinformation, according to a person familiar with the matter.

{"text": "Former traffic officer Sergei Torop, AKA Vissarion, arrested in special operation in Siberia Russian authorities mounted a special operation to arrest a former traffic police officer who claims to be the reincarnation of Jesus and has   based in the depths of Siberia for the past three decades. Helicopters and armed officers stormed communities run by Sergei Torop, known to his followers as Vissarion, and arrested him and two of his aides. Russia\u2019s investigative committee said it would charge him with organising an illegal religious organisation, alleging that the cult extorted money from followers and subjected them to emotional abuse. Torop, 59, with long grey hair and a beard, was led by masked troops to a helicopter. The operation involved agents from Russia\u2019s FSB security service as well as police and other agencies. Vadim Redkin, a former drummer in a Soviet-era boyband who is known as Vissarion\u2019s right-hand man, was also arrested, along with another aide, Vladimir Vedernikov. Torop, who lost his job as a traffic officer in 1989, claimed he experienced an \u201cawakening\u201d as the Soviet regime began to collapse. In 1991 he founded a movement now known as the Church of the Last Testament. Several thousand followers live in a series of remote hamlets in the Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia. Converts to the cult have included professionals from across   as well as pilgrims from abroad. \u201cI am not God. And it is a mistake to see Jesus as God. But I am the living word of God the father. Everything that God wants to say, he says through me,\u201d Vissarion told the Guardian  Russian media reported that in the original ideology of the cult, Vissarion claimed Jesus was watching over people from an orbit close to Earth, and the Virgin Mary was \u201crunning Russia\u201d, but later he declared himself to be Jesus. His commune mixes a selection of rites drawn from Orthodox Christianity with environmental edicts and a series of other rules. Veganism is enforced and monetary exchange is banned inside the commune. Followers wear austere clothing and count years starting from 1961, the year of Vissarion\u2019s birth, while Christmas has been replaced by a feast day on 14 January, his birthday. It is not clear what will happen to the disciples now that their leader has been arrested, nor is it clear why authorities decided to move now. The official Russian Orthodox church has   the group but officials have largely left the devotees alone. Some Russian media outlets reported that the community had become involved in a dispute with local business interests. "},
{"text": "The disclosure appeared to be aimed at helping President Trump benefit politically, and intelligence agencies were said to object to its release. WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s top intelligence official on Tuesday released unverified information about the 2016 campaign that appeared to be a bid to help Mr. Trump politically and was said to be disclosed over the objections of career intelligence officials who were concerned that the material could be Russian disinformation.  were the latest by John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence and previously an outspoken congressional ally of the president, that highlighted information that helped Mr. Trump but that critics have called distortions. Mr. Ratcliffe sought to shore up the credibility of the material, which centered on claims about Hillary Clinton, saying that it was not a product of Russian disinformation after initially acknowledging that it could be. But his initial disclosure, coming hours before the first  , offered fresh ammunition for Mr. Trump to attack his political enemies. In a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Ratcliffe laid out snippets of previously classified reports suggesting that Russian intelligence had acquired information that Mrs. Clinton had approved a plan for her 2016 campaign to \u201cstir up a scandal\u201d against Mr. Trump by tying him to the Russian hackers who had broken into Democratic servers. Other officials \u2014 including Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel appointed by the Justice Department, and the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 had evaluated and rejected the information in the years since, according to three current and former officials familiar with those inquiries. An official familiar with the committee\u2019s work said that Mr. Ratcliffe and Mr. Graham released it over the objections of other intelligence officials. \u201cIt\u2019s very disturbing to me that 35 days before an election, a director of national intelligence would release unverified\u201d rumors that originated from Russia, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He helped lead an exhaustive bipartisan investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign that   between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials. Mr. Warner said he had never seen anything like the letter on Tuesday from another director of national intelligence. Mr. Ratcliffe conducted a classified briefing on Tuesday evening for Mr. Graham about the sources behind the declassified intelligence he had released, according to people familiar with the matter. The last-minute briefing included no Democratic lawmakers; staff members for Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and the ranking member of Mr. Graham\u2019s committee, were blocked from attending, a deviation from normal practice for intelligence briefings on Capitol Hill. The impromptu briefing angered Democrats. Mr. Ratcliffe had promised to brief on the sources, but some congressional officials were surprised by the hasty meeting. They suggested that the scheduling reflected the need to brief Mr. Graham before congressional testimony by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey on Wednesday. Democrats called the releases one of the starkest examples of politicization of the intelligence agencies under Mr. Trump. While Mr. Ratcliffe \u2014 a former congressman from Texas with little intelligence experience \u2014 promised during his Senate confirmation hearing to be nonpartisan, since taking the job he has   over what career officials say is a greater threat from Russia and made other declassifications similarly beneficial to the president. \u201cRatcliffe is abusing his position exactly as I feared he would, and the abuse is accelerating as we near the election,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said in a statement. The letter on Tuesday was the first time Mr. Ratcliffe had released material dismissed by other officials as unverified rumor. He initially embraced that assessment, saying that \u201cthe Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.\u201d The intelligence agencies have stopped short of definitively assessing the material as disinformation. But in a statement hours after the release of the letter, Mr. Ratcliffe appeared to caveat his own warning. \u201cTo be clear, this is not Russian disinformation and has not been assessed as such by the intelligence community,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be briefing Congress on the sensitive sources and methods by which it was obtained in the coming days.\u201d The snippets of information that he released included an intelligence report sent to Mr. Comey on Sept. 7, 2016, and handwritten notes by the C.I.A. director at the time, John O. Brennan, that said he had briefed President Barack Obama on the information. A spokesman for Mr. Brennan said the release amounted to \u201cblatant politicization.\u201d \u201cRussian interference in the election was real, intense and unprecedented in scale and scope. It was authorized personally by Putin to hurt Secretary Clinton and to promote the electoral prospects of Donald Trump,\u201d said Nick Shapiro, Mr. Brennan\u2019s former deputy chief of staff at the C.I.A., referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. \u201cThe intelligence on this is incontrovertible and the analysis unimpeachable.\u201d Mr. Brennan was presenting a huge array of information about Russia to the White House in the summer of 2016. Including the information about what Russian intelligence was saying about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plans was not an endorsement of its accuracy, but a demonstration of how much information the United States was collecting on Moscow, a former intelligence official said. Other officials say they believe that the intelligence could simply be Russia\u2019s analysis of American politics, suggesting not a plot by the Clinton campaign to manufacture a scandal but a legitimate political critique of the Trump campaign\u2019s stance toward Russia. Officials said the timing was not a coincidence, pointing not only to the debate but also to Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony on Wednesday before Mr. Graham\u2019s committee, which is scrutinizing the bureau\u2019s Russia investigation that the president has long sought to falsely portray as a plot to undermine him. Mr. Graham brushed aside concerns about the veracity and provenance of the information. \u201cI\u2019m not saying whether it\u2019s true or not,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m asking Democrats, do you give a damn whether the F.B.I. investigated, or do you only care about investigating Trump?\u201d He added that it was \u201cnot far-fetched to believe the Clinton campaign would do something like this.\u201d As the election approaches, administration officials have been declassifying an array of material aimed at raising questions about the investigations of the 2016 campaign. The disclosures have mainly appeared to be aimed at energizing Mr. Trump\u2019s political base and fueling conspiracy theories that the national security establishment has been trying to stymie his presidency. Last week, Attorney General William P. Barr provided Mr. Graham with   that tried to further cast doubt on aspects of the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia\u2019s investigation. Former F.B.I. and Justice Department officials said the selective declassification appeared to be part of a pattern of politically motivated steps by Mr. Barr to bolster Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations about the inquiry. Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, seized on Mr. Ratcliffe\u2019s disclosure,  that it showed that Mrs. Clinton was behind what he called \u201cthe Russia Hoax.\u201d "},

{"text": "U.S. diplomats are trying to play hardball with Russia in negotiations over whether to extend New START. \nU.S. arms control envoy Marshall Billingslea speaks at a press conference. | Thomas Kronsteiner/Getty Images The Trump administration has asked the military to assess how quickly it could pull nuclear weapons out of storage and load them onto bombers and submarines if an arms control treaty with Russia is allowed to expire in February, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The request to U.S. Strategic Command in Nebraska is part of a strategy to pressure Moscow into renegotiating the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty before the U.S. presidential election, the people said. In making the request, the Trump administration wants to underscore that it is serious about letting the treaty lapse if Russia fails to meet U.S. demands. The negotiating team is leery that Russia is dragging out the talks in the hope that Joe Biden \u2014 who has pledged to extend New START under what Moscow believes will be more favorable terms than what this White House is offering \u2014 wins the election. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear signal that the costs for not negotiating before the election are going to go up,\u201d said one of the people, who requested anonymity to relay sensitive discussions. The Trump administration is \u201ctrying to create an incentive, and it\u2019s a real incentive, for the Russians to sit down and actually negotiate.\u201d The request for the assessment came from a group of officials at the National Security Council and State, Defense and Energy departments that\u2019s supporting Ambassador Marshall Billingslea in negotiations with Moscow to try to replace New START before it runs out in February. how long it would take to load nuclear weapons now in reserve onto long-range bombers, ballistic missile submarines and land-based silos to beef up the U.S. nuclear force in the event Russia increases its arsenal. It comes as Billingslea has publicly raised the possibility of putting more weapons on bombers and submarines if New START lapses and has sharpened his rhetoric in recent days to try to secure more concessions from the Russians. \u201cIt would certainly be a question that you would want to ask STRATCOM,\u201d said retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Frank Klotz, who oversaw nuclear forces before serving as head of the DOE\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration. \u201cYou would want to fully understand all the possible implications of your negotiating approach, both if it should succeed or, alternatively, if it should fail.\" But former senior arms control and military officials also consider the move a risky gambit. It could send a message that the Trump administration, which has already pulled out of two other nuclear-related treaties with Russia, is no longer interested in any limits on the world\u2019s largest arsenals. And it could goad the Russians into taking similar steps. \u201cI call that megaphone diplomacy,\u201d said Rose Gottemoeller, who served as deputy secretary general of NATO until last year and negotiated New START when she was at the State Department. \u201cDo we want to end up in a less stable place? Because we would be nuclear arms racing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very stupid,\u201d added a former GOP arms control official who declined to be identified because he still advises the government. \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense to threaten to upload. It becomes a valid leveraging point only if the other side can\u2019t do it. The Russians can do it, too.\u201d \u201cBut more importantly,\u201d this person added, \u201cthe systems we have deployed today are the ones we believe are necessary to provide an adequate deterrent. There is no obvious reason and every reason not to in the absence of a change in the threat. It\u2019s not going to scare the Russians. The likelihood of success with the Russians is about nil.\" A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on Billingslea's behalf. Capt. Bill Clinton, a spokesperson for Strategic Command, declined to address the military\u2019s role in the deliberations. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about future operations, and really can\u2019t speculate on arms control talks (as that is not [our] responsibility),\u201d he wrote in an email.

The position of the Trump administration, which withdrew from both the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces and the Open Skies treaties, has been that New START is too narrow and a replacement is needed that covers more classes of weapons, such as \u201ctactical\u201d or battlefield nuclear weapons. At the outset of negotiations in June, the U.S. also insisted that China be party to any new agreement, but dropped that demand after Beijing balked. The U.S. negotiating team has insisted on a number of Russian concessions: a commitment to follow-on talks about a new arms deal that includes all U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons; a pledge to eventually bring in China, which is projected to double its relatively small nuclear arsenal in the next decade; and strong compliance measures. Billingslea\u2019s current public negotiating position is that the U.S. and Russia must agree on at least the outlines of a new framework that both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin can sign in order for Washington to consider extending New START. Asked in an interview published last week by a Russian newspaper if the Trump administration would scrap the treaty if the two sides can\u2019t agree on such a \u201cpresidential agreement,\u201d Billingslea responded, \u201cabsolutely.\u201d \u201cIn such a situation, we will not extend the treaty,\u201d he told Kommersant, according to an English translation of the interview. \u201cGiven all the deficiencies of New START, we consider it disadvantageous to the United States. It imposes constraints on the United States that it does not impose on Russia.\u201d In the same interview, Billingslea also indicated that the United States would take steps to increase the number of its deployed nuclear warheads if the pact is not extended. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, we will simply reconvert our weapons as soon as the treaty expires in February,\u201d he told the newspaper. Billingslea also said that the longer the Russians delay, the less attractive it would be for Moscow. \u201cI suspect that after President Trump wins reelection, if Russia has not taken up our offer, that the price of admission, as we would say in the U.S., goes up,\u201d he said. \nU.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands. | Chris McGrath/Getty Images  that the U.S. could spend Russia, as well as China, \u201cinto oblivion\u201d in a  Already, the U.S. and Russia have a much larger number of weapons in storage that could be placed on alert if they decided to take that course. , which tracks global inventories of atomic arms, the U.S. has 3,800 warheads stockpiled, while Russia has 4,310. Some in reserve could be made ready to deploy more quickly than others, according to  , director of FAS\u2019 Nuclear Security Project. Of the three legs of the nuclear triad \u2014 bombers, submarines and missile silos \u2014 the quickest would be the bombers. \u201cThose weapons are just a few hundred yards from the aircraft,\u201d Kristensen said. \u201cThey could be loaded in days. Others would have to be transported to the bases. Maybe a week or so.\u201d Next would be the fleet of Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines, beginning with those already in port and the rest when they return from deployment. Finally, there are the intercontinental ballistic missiles deployed in underground silos at bases in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. \u201cThe slowest leg would be the ICBMs,\u201d Kristensen said. \u201cThey only have so much capacity to do that. That\u2019s a very slow process. That would take a long time for 400 silos. Many months.\u201d Both the ICBMs and the subs currently carry only one nuclear warhead on each missile, but they are designed to carry more.

I would argue they could get a jump on us.\u201d Klotz, who also served as defense attach\u00e9 in Moscow during previous arms control negotiations and   at the government-funded Rand Corporation, agreed. \u201cIt's my personal view that the United States might initially be at a disadvantage,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russian nuclear modernization program is already well underway, while the U.S. program is still in its very early stages. Moreover, the systems the Russians have developed generally have the ability to carry more warheads than analogous U.S. systems.\u201d The Trump administration, he added, \u201crather glibly says, \u2018we'll spend you into oblivion\u2019 in any potential nuclear arms race. But wouldn\u2019t it be far better to avoid getting into that situation in the first place, especially when there are so many other capabilities our military needs?\u201d Kristensen, of the Federation of American Scientists, said the prospect of setting off a new competition to increase the two sides\u2019 arsenals \u201conly underscores the need to keep New START to keep those numbers in check.\u201d \u201cWithout it you don\u2019t really know where you are going.\u201d "},
{"text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The Russian group accused of meddling in the 2016 U.S. election has posed as an independent news outlet to target right-wing social media users ahead of this year\u2019s vote, two people familiar with an FBI probe into the activity told Reuters. The latest operation centred around a pseudo media organisation called the Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens (NAEBC), which was run by people associated with the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, the sources said. U.S. prosecutors say the agency played a key role in Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election in favour of President Donald Trump, and Facebook and Twitter exposed a fake left-wing media outlet in September which they said was run by people connected to the organisation. NAEBC and its activity, which have not been previously reported, now show that Russian attempts to influence U.S. voters ahead of the 2020 election have targeted both sides of the political divide. The website predominantly focused on U.S. politics and current events, republishing articles from conservative media and paying real Americans to write about politically-sensitive issues. A network of accounts posing as editors and journalists then promoted the articles on social media sites favoured by right-wing users. Topics covered by NAEBC ranged from attacks on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden to criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement and praise for Wisconsin shooter Kyle Rittenhouse. Russia has repeatedly denied allegations of election interference. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he did not know anything about NAEBC or the fake left-wing news site, Peace Data. \u201cThe Russian state does not engage in such activity,\u201d he said. When asked by email about NAEBC\u2019s connections to Russia, a person identifying themselves as Nora Berka, an assistant editor, said: \u201cI have no idea what does NAEBC have to do with it.\u201d The person declined to speak by phone or video call. After Reuters contacted NAEBC for comment, social media accounts in the name of Nora Berka and other NAEBC staff removed all references to the website from their profiles and deleted some of their previous posts. NAEBC presents itself as a \u201cfree and independent\u201d media outlet based in Hungary with a mission to promote conservative and right-wing voices. Its main page carries a warning to its readers: \u201cDon\u2019t get yourself fooled.\u201d The website\u2019s own name, however, is a pun on a Russian expletive meaning to deceive or \u201cscrew over.\u201d Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at social media analytics firm Graphika, analysed the website after being alerted to the activity by Reuters. He said NAEBC and the left-wing Peace Data showed Russian influence operations had evolved since 2016. \u201cBut the overall strategy looks unchanged: energise Trump supporters, depress support for Biden, and target both sides with divisive and polarising messages,\u201d he said. NAEBC has been active since late June and built a small network of personas on Twitter and LinkedIn - some of which used computer-generated photographs of non-existent people - to solicit articles from followers and freelance journalists, according to the Graphika analysis  Nimmo said the accounts failed to attract any significant following with many posts only receiving a handful of shares, but got more traction on Gab and Parler - two social media platforms favoured by right-wing users for their lax approach to content moderation. Paul Rockwell, head of trust and safety at LinkedIn, said his company had previously suspended three NAEBC accounts. \u201cThis is part of our regular work to actively seek out signs of state-sponsored activity on the platform and quickly take action against bad actors,\u201d he said. Facebook said it had stopped one attempt to create an NAEBC account and blocked the website from being shared on its platforms. Twitter declined to comment. Before being contacted by Reuters, the company had already suspended NAEBC\u2019s main account and an account in the name of Nora Berka, as well as blocking the NAEBC website address as a \u201cpotentially harmful\u201d link. A spokeswoman for Parler said the company was not aware of NAEBC and had not discussed the activity with law enforcement. Gab CEO Andrew Torba said NAEBC did not break his site\u2019s guidelines. \u201cIt looks like a blog sharing news stories and opinions. It\u2019s irrelevant to us who runs it or why,\u201d he said. A senior U.S. security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said Russian operatives were increasingly recruiting \u201cunwitting Americans\u201d to write articles and post online. Reuters identified three writers located in the United States who contributed articles to NAEBC. Two of them were established authors who had written for a number of right-wing outlets, while the third was an amateur journalist. One of the writers, who asked not to be named publicly, said they had been working for NAEBC for the last month with no knowledge of its Russian backing. Emails seen by Reuters show the website operated much like its left-wing counterpart, Peace Data. Writers were paid from $50 to $75 per an article, and money was sent promptly via online transfer. NAEBC staff also gave detailed instructions for the articles they commissioned and how they should be framed. In late August, a person emailing as Nora Berka asked one writer for a story about calls to defund U.S. police departments in the wake of nationwide protests over a string of high-profile killings of black men by white officers. NAEBC asked the author to question \u201chow American citizens are supposed to protect themselves without police,\u201d and specifically mention increased gun purchases as well as incidents of violence and shootings. \u201cHere we should mention that a lot of democrats support de-funding the police,\u201d the person writing as Berka said. \u201cAnd in case if they win 2020, it can happen.\u201d Additional reporting by Elizabeth Culliford in Birmingham, England and Christopher Bing in Washington; Editing by Chris Sanders and Edward Tobin All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

They travelled to Moscow for stem cell transplants after initial travel plans were cancelled because of the pandemic.  The procedure aims to \"reboot\" their immune systems, stopping their MS in its tracks. After a month of gruelling treatment, they have now travelled back to Scotland and were met by their families at Edinburgh Airport. Jill said: \"I can't even explain how amazing it is to be back. It's been really hard, but it'll be worth it.\" She said she had come home MS-free. \"Next is the long recovery and rehabilitation. If this gives us a chance to get our lives back, I'll take it.\" The women were unable to get the transplants through the NHS in Scotland, however Michele's treatment was paid for through crowd funding. \"It's been absolutely amazing,\" she said. \"Everyone has just been so kind. I'm in awe of them. The generosity has just been unbelievable, it really has.\" Over 15,000 people in Scotland have multiple sclerosis, a lifelong neurological condition which affects the brain and spinal cord and can lead to serious disability.  Instead of fighting off infection, the immune system attacks the nerves which control different parts of the body.    The illness forced Jill to give up her career in radio and with her health worsening, the mother of twins from Edinburgh decided to undergo the transplant.   Michele, who's from Tain in the Highlands, had reached the same decision and they travelled together to Moscow last month. Haematopietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an aggressive procedure that carries risks.   The MS Society Scotland says for some people it results in \"life-changing results\" but it's not effective for all types of the disease. Stem cells are taken from the patient's bone marrow or blood before chemotherapy wipes out the immune system. The stem cells are then reintroduced to the body, where they grow a new immune system. The women could take up to a year to recover and will be extremely vulnerable to serious infections for months. Jill said: \"We won't be able to see anyone for the next few weeks outside our immediate families, and probably it'll be after new year before we can actually see other see people.   \"We'll be monitored all the time to make sure our recovery is going well enough. We've got a baby immune system now and we just have to be really, really careful. \"We've overcome the big hurdle, the one that really punished the body.

Of course she did. In late July 2016, Hillary Clinton, in an effort to divert attention from the email scandal that was haunting her presidential bid, directed her campaign to peddle a political narrative that Russia\u2019s suspected hacking and leaking of Democratic Party emails was in furtherance of a conspiracy between Russian President   and Donald Trump to swing the election to Trump. That is, as I argued in my book\u00a0\u201c ,\u201d the Clinton campaign dreamed up, paid for, and peddled the Trump\u2013Russia collusion farce. And in promoting it,   former secretary of state had a willing and able partner in the Obama administration \u2014 very much including its intelligence and law-enforcement apparatus. It was amazing to watch Democrats play Twister this week, as National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe added  In that first revelation, via letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ratcliffe explained that, because our spy agencies have very effective foreign-intelligence-gathering methods, they were able to \u201cobtain insight\u201d into a Russian intelligence analysis that concluded Clinton orchestrated the damaging political narrative. That is,\u00a0Clinton actually did what she accused Trump of doing: She colluded with Russians (through yet another foreigner she recruited to meddle in the 2016 presidential campaign: the ludicrous former British spy Christopher Steele) in order to damage Trump\u2019s campaign and cinch the election for herself. As ever with the Clintonistas: When they\u2019re moving their lips, they\u2019re projecting. Ratcliffe\u2019s initial revelation came with a caveat: While our spy agencies judged Moscow\u2019s analysis about Clinton to be authentic (in the sense of truly being a Russian intel product), they could not vouch for its accuracy (i.e., it might reflect what the Russians really believed, but it might alternatively be exaggeration or fabrication).

{"text": "Head of armed forces says both China and Russia trying to undermine cohesion in west Last modified on Thu 1 Oct 2020 08.10 BST Russia is seeking to destabilise countries around the world by sowing disinformation about coronavirus vaccines that is shared rapidly across social media, the head of the armed forces has warned. Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of defence staff, said the propaganda tactic reflected a strategy of \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d aggressively undertaken by Beijing as well as Moscow \u201cdesigned to undermine cohesion\u201d across the west. The senior general accused \u201cautocratic rivals\u201d of \u201cmanipulating the information environment\u201d to exploit the Covid-19 crisis for strategic gain \u2013 including \u201cpro-Russian vaccine politics\u201d \u2013 in a speech  Their \u201cdisinformation narratives\u201d were designed to permeate anti-vaccination social media groups, Carter added,   that spread rapidly from Ukraine. In July, a fake press release was posted to websites of the pro-Russian self-declared state in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine. It falsely claimed that the US had conducted vaccine trials on Ukrainian volunteers, some of whom had died. The trials never happened but the misleading narrative spread in several languages, including on  , despite multiple attempts to fact-check and  Carter said it was an example of \u201cdigital authoritarianism\u201d alongside well-known Kremlin cyber and hacking attacks, in a rare policy speech delivered with the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, sitting alongside him. A similar approach was adopted by China, he added, where \u201cthe Chinese Communist party is forging a future of mass surveillance\u201d and ranking and monitoring of individuals based on how they behave online. The speech comes in the run-up to a five-year integrated review of defence and foreign policy that is expected to see the UK seek to invest more heavily in cyber and covert capabilities, reflecting a belief that Britain is already engaged in a persistent low-level conflict with authoritarian rivals. The British army already operates a propaganda and disinformation suppression unit, 77 Brigade. But the military is traditionally tight-lipped about the scope and scale of its activities and Carter\u2019s speech offered few precise clues as to how the UK will respond. Senior defence sources said scaling up Britain\u2019s information warfare capability was \u201cnot going to be a massive increase of expense\u201d and that it would involve, in part, closer intelligence and information sharing with a range of allies. \u201cThe bill that\u2019s attached is not significant,\u201d they said. Countries such as Russia and China, Carter argued, \u201csee the strategic context as a continuous struggle in which non-military and military instruments are used unconstrained by any distinction between peace and war\u201d. The general added: \u201cTheir goal is to win without going to war: to achieve their objectives by breaking our willpower, using attacks below the threshold that would prompt a war-fighting response.\u201d In the summer, Britain accused Russian state-sponsored hackers of   in the UK, US and Canada involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine, with the apparent intention of stealing the research. Intelligence officials said the cyber-attackers were from a group called APT29, linked variously to the country\u2019s FSB or SVR intelligence agencies, in attacks that were described by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. As part of the military\u2019s response, Carter unveiled  . It recognised the need \u201cto compete below the threshold of war in order to deter war\u201d to prevent \u201cone\u2019s adversaries from achieving their objectives in fait accompli strategies\u201d.

Press play to listen to this article Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the former comedian whose party is called \u201cServant of the People\u201d after the TV show he once starred in, has some advice for his strongman neighbors, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko: Listen to the people. In an interview with POLITICO ahead of a visit to Brussels on Tuesday, Zelenskiy said he gets an eerily familiar feeling watching the protests in Belarus, and also in Khabarovsk in Russia\u2019s far east \u2014 given that Ukraine has had not one but two street revolutions already this century. \u201cWhat is happening today in Khabarovsk is, I think, the very clear position of people who come out [on to the streets] \u2014 that they have an opinion,\u201d Zelenskiy said in the interview. \u201cAnd this is the most important thing \u2014 that they cannot be influenced by only the information policy of the Russian Federation. You can\u2019t brainwash them. It is clear that at any moment there will be a social explosion. We see the same thing in Belarus today. People are tired of these politics.\u201d  playing a fictional president on the satirical \u201cServant of the People\u201d sitcom   last year, said that those in power must listen to those they serve, or face revolt. \u201cCan what is happening now in Belarus be the same in Russia? I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cBut what I see is that the people of Belarus [where protests have multiplied following the disputed reelection of President Lukashenko in August] will no longer stand for the policies that were before. Authorities need to listen to the people. And, most importantly, throwing people in police wagons for having a different opinion; or using batons; or certain means against people; you can\u2019t build a dialogue. People need to be heard. If people want change, then it\u2019s time for that change.\u201d Zelenskiy leads a country at war, and in the interview he said he will arrive to meet with EU leaders on Tuesday, bearing a request and an offer. Zelenskiy noted that Ukraine has had two recent revolutions \u2014 the Orange Revolution of 2004-05, and its Revolution of Dignity a decade later. \u201cI see there, approximately the same situation,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople do not want to live as before \u2026 If there is no dialogue, if the authorities do not talk about it with the people, and pretend that it is happening \u2018somewhere, in one area or another, this is not the whole country,\u2019 then there will be a wave. You know what the sea is \u2014 and a wave always washes away all the past.\u201d Zelenskiy leads a country at war, and in the interview he said he will arrive to meet with EU leaders on Tuesday, bearing a request and an offer. The request is that the EU continue, or even step up, its support for Ukraine in the ongoing conflict with Russia \u2014 by maintaining tough sanctions against Moscow, and further developing economic and political ties with Kyiv. The offer is to help manufacture a coronavirus vaccine once effective immunization is ready for mass production. In the interview, Zelenskiy reiterated his commitment to the Minsk II peace process, but also his firm view that local elections cannot be held in the embattled areas of eastern Ukraine \u2014 as demanded by Russian President Putin \u2014 until Ukraine regains full control of its external borders. Without control of the border, he said it would be impossible to hold a free and fair election and for international election observers to verify the process. \u201cThe Ukrainian border should be controlled by the Ukrainian authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cI say this openly and I believe that it cannot be otherwise \u2026 it\u2019s just physically impossible.\u201d Zelenskiy also said that Ukraine\u2019s destiny is now clearly in the West. \u201cUkrainians  ,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand that this is the way to be a member of the EU. I believe that we are mentally more European than, sorry, some EU countries.\u201d In briefings on Monday, senior EU officials said they would use the meeting with Zelenskiy and European Council President Charles Michel to emphasize the bloc\u2019s political and economic support for Kyiv. They will encourage Zelenskiy to continue pushing efforts to reduce corruption and carry out an array of judicial and economic reforms. EU officials said they would also reiterate their support for maintaining sanctions against Russia, which Zelenskiy in the interview said is his top priority request. \u201cThe EU will continue to show our support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d a senior EU official said. Despite that support, the Minsk II peace agreement, brokered and guaranteed by France and Germany, has barely inched forward since   with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 largely because of the standoff over holding local elections and changes to the Ukrainian constitution that would grant \u201cspecial status\u201d to the embattled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 both currently controlled by pro-Russian separatist administrations.

But his failure to end the war as promised during his election campaign has led to a sharp decline in support to roughly half of the 73 percent who voted for him, according to recent polls. In the interview, Zelenskiy readily conceded that he did not agree with some provisions of the Minsk II accord, negotiated by his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, such as those that required Ukraine to make constitutional changes, but that it was the only path to a settlement. \u201cMinsk was signed,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cAm I personally satisfied with the format of Minsk, the sequence of points in Minsk and the wording of some points that have been signed? Personally, I am not completely.\u201d But he added, \u201cThat this is the only format in which we work today is true.\u201d As for further constitutional changes demanded by Putin, he said: \u201cNo one can effect a change to the constitution of Ukraine except the people of Ukraine.\u201d \u201cIt is very important for us that Ukraine does not interfere in the elections of any country\u201d \u2014  Zelenskiy insisted that he had no choice but to engage with Putin, and in a sign of the  , he mostly sidestepped a question about the Russian leader\u2019s role in the poisoning of the opposition figure Alexei Navalny. \u201cThe whole world is closely following the details and results of the investigation into the tragedy with Mr. Navalny, which are to be published by the German side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all want to see it.\u201d Zelenskiy similarly engaged in well-practiced evasive tactics when asked about the U.S. presidential election.

{"text": "These questions are on the minds of the US intelligence community in the run-up to November's vote.   warns foreign powers will use \"covert and overt influence measures\" to try to sway US voters, singling out Russia, China and Iran. The three should not be compounded, as each, in the view of US intelligence, has their own goal and their own capabilities.  The assessments themselves are under scrutiny too -   he was asked to downplay the threat posed by Russia as it \"made the president look bad\".  So with a little over a month to go, what do US voters need to know? As you may have noticed, Russia had a scene-stealing role in the 2016 US election and its aftermath.  In short, US intelligence believe Russia tried to sway the vote in favour of Donald Trump, pointing to meetings between his team and Russian officials, a cyber attack against Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democrats, the targeting of state voter databases, and efforts to amplify false or partisan material online. Last month a Republican-led Senate panel gave further support to the view Russia wanted Trump to win, concluding his campaign was an easy target for foreign influence but stopping short of alleging criminal conspiracy.  As for 2020, this time swap Hillary Clinton for Joe Biden. In his assessment, intended to be read by the American public, the head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) William Evanina said Russia was \"using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice-President Biden\". In the view of FBI director Christopher Wray, Russia has never stopped meddling, calling efforts in the 2018 congressional elections a \"dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020\".  Russia has consistently denied interfering in foreign elections. Earlier this year a Kremlin spokesman called accusations of meddling \"paranoid announcements\" that had \"nothing to do with the truth\".  Whether Russia wants a second term for President Trump or not, another view often expressed by analysts is that the country has a broader aim of destabilising rivals by spreading confusion. For example this year an EU document alleged there was   to make it harder for the bloc to communicate its response. Russia called the claims unfounded.  Joe Biden recently warned there would be a \"price to pay\" if Russia continues to interfere, calling Russia an \"opponent\" of the US. President Trump has frequently downplayed allegations of Russian interference, putting him at odds with his own intelligence experts. After a 2018 summit with Vladimir Putin, asked whether he believed the US intelligence community or the Russian president about the claims Mr Trump said: \"President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be.\" He later said he had misspoken. Prominent voices in the Trump administration have argued that it is China, rather than Russia, that poses the main threat this year. \"I've seen intelligence. That's what I've concluded,\" the Attorney General William Barr said. Democrat Adam Schiff, who chairs the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, accused Mr Barr of \"flat-out lying\" with the comments. In his assessment, Mr Evanina said US intelligence believes \"China prefers that President Trump - whom Beijing sees as unpredictable - does not win re-election\".  \"China is expanding its influence efforts to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and counter criticism of China,\" he said. The use of the word \"influence\" is notable. Although China has sophisticated ways to influence opinions -   \"content farms, 'astroturf' commenter brigades, and fabricated accounts and personas on social media channels\" how far China is actually prepared to go is unclear. \"China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action,\" said Mr Evanina. The intention may be more to do with promoting China's worldview. Facebook recently shut down a network of China-linked accounts much of which supported the Chinese state, such as its interests in the disputed South China Sea.  , saying it is not \"interested or willing to do so\".  This month, President Trump approvingly retweeted an article on the Trump leaning Breitbart website entitled \"China seems 'to be favouring Joe Biden' in presidential election\". \"Of course they want Biden. I have taken $Billions from China and given it to our Farmers and U.S. Treasury. China would own the U.S. if Biden & Hunter got in!\" Mr Trump wrote, referring to Joe Biden's son Hunter. US-China ties are at a low ebb, with disputes over everything from the coronavirus to China's imposition of a controversial security law in Hong Kong. Joe Biden has sought to fend off accusations from President Trump he is soft on China,   Democrats though argue that when it comes to the election at least, it is Russia that is being most aggressive.  In 2016, the US government, as well as social media companies, were slow to confront Russian interference. This time no one is staying quiet but the landscape has changed. Companies are talking loudly about what they are doing and the US intelligence community is publishing regular assessments. But the issue has become deeply politicised. Democrats are focused on Russian interference helping President Trump whilst his supporters have tried to switch attention to Chinese influence working against his re-election. National security officials have tried to walk a fine line - acknowledging both are happening (as well as lower-level Iranian influence) but trying to avoid acknowledging there are differences because of concerns of being drawn into the partisan fight.  Russian interference has looked both more organised and covert so far, but not necessarily yet on the same scale or with the same impact as the hack and leak of emails from Democrats in 2016. Tactics have also evolved with those seeking to interference often amplifying genuine, US news and posts rather than making up fake material. And there are worries that more may be coming in the closing stages of the campaign including potentially efforts to undermine the credibility of the electoral process itself. In his statement Mr Evanina says that Tehran is against another term for President Trump, which it believes will result \"in a continuation of US pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change\". Iran's efforts, he says, will focus on \"on-line influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-US content\". Backing up the allegations made by US intelligence, computing giant  On Iran, it said an Iranian group known as Phosphorus had unsuccessfully sought to access accounts of White House officials and Mr Trump's campaign staff between May and June of this year. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman called Microsoft's report \"farcical\". \"Iran is not concerned about who will take presidency in the White House,\" said Saeed Khatibzadeh. A report on Iranian influence efforts earlier this year from   being focussed on promoting a national agenda, such as its bid for regional supremacy. \"Nearly all content spread by Iran's digital influence efforts relates directly to its worldview or specific foreign policy objectives. Consequently, it is easier to identify the operations of Iran than those of other actors like Russia, whose content is more likely to be politically agnostic,\" it said.  Iran has not figured as prominently in the US election as Russia or China, both in terms of its possible influence or in policy.  President Trump has pursued an aggressive policy against Iran, withdrawing from the nuclear deal and ordering the killing of the powerful general Qasem Soleimani. Joe Biden says this policy has failed. In an editorial for CNN, he said there was \"a smart way to be tough on Iran\", pledging to push back the country's \"destabilising activities\" while also offering it a \"path to diplomacy\".

The Washington Post  Mr. Putin\u2019s direction, national security officials have said, should be of little surprise. Russia has become an authoritarian country under him, and little in its foreign affairs occurs without his knowledge or blessing, American officials have repeatedly said. Russian efforts to influence American politics have continued steadily since 2016, even if the volume of disinformation has ebbed and flowed. But the C.I.A.\u2019s lower level of confidence in the new assessment allows Mr. Trump and his allies to treat the allegations of Mr. Putin\u2019s involvement as unproven. For years, many Republicans have taken issue with the C.I.A. analysis of Russian interference. John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, who was an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump while a member of Congress, and other Republicans have argued that Mr. Putin\u2019s goal is to sow chaos, not to favor one candidate over another. And Mr. Trump himself remains hostile to arguments that Russia is intervening to support him. After the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, testified last week that Russia was   in the United States and \u201cdenigrate Vice President Biden,\u201d Mr. Trump   publicly, saying he should have also emphasized China\u2019s election interference efforts. American intelligence officials say that while China opposes Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election, Beijing has not mounted significant covert efforts to hamper the president\u2019s campaign. But intelligence officials said there is little doubt that Mr. Putin is broadly orchestrating Russian campaigns and has continued to allow his intelligence operatives to try to influence American politics. The key questions that American intelligence agencies have not answered are the extent of Russia\u2019s effort and how open Mr. Putin wants to be about it. In a statement in August, William R. Evanina, the intelligence official in charge of election interference briefings, said Russia was trying to  . Mr. Evanina cited information released by Mr. Derkach. Mr. Evanina was set to brief members of Congress\u2019s intelligence committees this week. Mr. Ratcliffe had sought to block in-person testimony to Congress, citing leaks. But faced with criticism from Republicans and Democrats, Mr. Ratcliffe modified his position to block only all-member briefings. Some officials have said the recent C.I.A. assessment demonstrates that the agency remains willing to push intelligence that Mr. Trump disagrees with. His administration has also taken action to try to raise awareness of Russian activities. The Treasury Department on Sept. 10 described Mr. Derkach as \u201can active Russian agent\u201d with ties to Moscow\u2019s intelligence services and said he was involved in efforts to influence elections. He released doctored tapes of Mr. Biden that American officials have said were edited to mislead the public. American intelligence agencies have tried to track his efforts to push information critical of Mr. Biden to lobbyists and members of Congress, information that was included in the C.I.A. assessment, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Derkach denies that he works on behalf of Russia. The president has pushed various theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election and has supported efforts to raise questions about the work Mr. Biden\u2019s son did for a Ukrainian energy company, namely   led by Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, that Democrats have warned is the target of Russian disinformation. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has criticized Republicans in Congress for investigating his ties to Ukraine and his son\u2019s work for the energy company. On Tuesday, Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesman, said some members of Congress \u201chave chosen to be accessories to foreign influence operations\u201d and attacked Mr. Trump\u2019s Russia policy. \u201cAs Joe Biden has said for months, it is absolutely clear who Vladimir Putin wants to win this election \u2014 because Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been a gift to the Kremlin,\u201d Mr. Bates said. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer who has led the efforts to gather information about Mr. Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine, has taken information from Mr. Derkach. However, the recent C.I.A. analysis did not cite Mr. Giuliani by name, according to a person familiar with the matter. "},

{"text": "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then  To revist this article, visit My Profile, then  To revist this article, visit My Profile, then  To revist this article, visit My Profile, then   unidentified hackers broke into an agency of the US federal government and stole its data is troubling enough. But it becomes all the more disturbing when those unidentified intruders are identified\u2014and appear likely to be part of a notorious team of cyberspies working in the service of   Last week the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency   that hackers had penetrated a US federal agency. It identified neither the attackers nor the agency, but did detail the hackers' methods and their use of a new and unique form of malware in an operation that successfully stole target data. Now, clues uncovered by a researcher at cybersecurity firm Dragos and an FBI notification to hacking victims obtained by WIRED in July suggest a likely answer to the mystery of who was behind the intrusion: They appear to be Fancy Bear, a team of hackers working for Russia's GRU. Also known as APT28, the group has been responsible for everything from  \"They\u2019re a formidable actor, and they're still capable of getting access to sensitive areas.\" The clues pointing to APT28 are based in part on a notification the FBI sent to targets of a hacking campaign in May of this year,  . The notification warned that APT28 was broadly targeting US networks, including government agencies and educational institutions, and listed several IP addresses they were using in their operations. Dragos researcher Joe Slowik noticed that one IP address identifying a server in Hungary used in that APT28 campaign matched an IP address listed in the CISA advisory. That would suggest that APT28 used the same Hungarian server in the intrusion described by CISA\u2014and that at least one of the attempted intrusions described by the FBI was successful. \"Based on the infrastructure overlap, the series of behaviors associated with the event, and the general timing and targeting of the US government, this seems to be something very similar to\u2014if not a part of\u2014the campaign linked to APT28 earlier this year,\" says Slowik, the former head of Los Alamos National Labs\u2019 Computer Emergency Response Team. Aside from that FBI notification, Slowik also found a second infrastructure connection. A report last year from the Department of Energy warned that APT28 had probed a US government organization's network from a server in Latvia, listing that server's IP address. And that Latvian IP address, too, reappeared in the hacking operation described in the CISA advisory. Together, those matching IPs create a web of shared infrastructure that ties the operations together. \"There are one-to-one overlaps in the two cases,\" Slowik says. Confusingly, some of the IP addresses listed in the FBI, DOE, and CISA documents also seem to overlap with known cybercriminal operations, Slowik notes, such as Russian fraud forums and servers used by banking trojans. But he suggests that means Russia's state-sponsored hackers are most likely reusing cybercriminal infrastructure, perhaps to create deniability. WIRED reached out to CISA, as well as the FBI and DOE, but none responded to our request for comment. Although it doesn't name APT28, CISA's advisory does detail step-by-step how the hackers carried out their intrusion inside an unidentified federal agency. The hackers had somehow obtained working usernames and passwords for multiple employees, which they used to gain entry onto the network. CISA admits it doesn't know how those credentials were obtained, but the report speculates that the attackers may have used a known vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPNs that CISA says has been exploited widely across the federal government. The intruders then used command line tools to move among the agency's machines, before downloading a piece of custom malware. They then used that malware to access the agency's file server and move collections of files to machines the hackers controlled, compressing them into .zip files they could more easily steal. While CISA didn't make a sample of the hackers' custom trojan available to researchers, security researcher Costin Raiu says that the attributes of the malware matched another sample uploaded to the malware research repository VirusTotal from somewhere in the United Arab Emirates. By analyzing that sample, Raiu found that it appears to be a unique creation built from a combination of the common hacking tools Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike, but with no obvious links to known hackers, and obfuscated with multiple layers of encryption. \"That wrapping makes it kind of interesting,\" says Raiu, director of Kaspersky's global research and analysis team. \"It is kind of unusual and rare in the sense that we couldn\u2019t find connections with anything else.\" Even aside from their 2016 breaches of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, Russia's APT28 hackers loom over the 2020 election. Earlier this month   and campaigns on both sides of the political aisle. According to Microsoft, the group has used a combination of password-spraying that tries common passwords across many users' accounts and password brute-forcing that tries many passwords against a single account. But if APT28 is indeed the hacker group described in the CISA advisory, it's a reminder that they're also capable of more sophisticated and targeted spying operations, says John Hultquist, the director of intelligence at security firm FireEye, which didn't independently confirm Slowik's findings linking the CISA report to APT28. \"They\u2019re a formidable actor, and they're still capable of getting access to sensitive areas,\" says Hultquist. APT28, before its more recent hack-and-leak operations of the last few years, has a long history of espionage operations that have targeted US, NATO, and Eastern European government and military targets. The CISA advisory, along with the DOE and FBI findings that track related APT28 hacking campaigns, all suggest that those spying operations continue today. \"It's certainly not surprising that Russian intelligence would be trying penetrate the US government. That's kind of what they do,\" says Slowik. \"But it is worth identifying that not only is such activity continuing, it's been successful.\" WIRED is where tomorrow is realized.

{"text": "Critics of the shift in approach say it seems designed to appease the president. \nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, Gina Haspel and President Donald Trump attend the swearing-in ceremony for Haspel as CIA director May 21, 2018, in Langley, Va. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images The CIA has made it harder for intelligence about Russia to reach the White House, stoking fears among current and former officials that information is being suppressed to please a president known to erupt in anger whenever he is confronted with bad news about Moscow. Nine current and former officials said in interviews that CIA Director Gina Haspel has become extremely cautious about which, if any, Russia-related intelligence products make their way to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. Haspel also has been keeping a close eye on the agency\u2019s fabled \u201cRussia House,\u201d whose analysts she often disagrees with and sometimes accuses of purposefully misleading her. Last year, three of the people said, Haspel tasked the CIA\u2019s general counsel, Courtney Elwood, with reviewing virtually every product that comes out of Russia House, which is home to analysts and targeters who are experts in Russia and the post-Soviet space, before it \u201cgoes downtown\u201d to the White House. One former CIA lawyer called it \u201cunprecedented that a general counsel would be involved to this extent.\u201d  Four of the people said the change has resulted in less intelligence on Russia making its way to the White House, but the exact reason for that \u2014 whether Elwood has been blocking it, or whether Russia officers have become disillusioned and are producing less, or even self-censoring for fear of being reprimanded \u2014 is less clear.  One administration official explained the reduced Russia-related intelligence flow from CIA to the National Security Council as a matter of \u201cquality over quantity.\u201d Another administration official said that while the CIA is not the only agency that provides intelligence to the NSC, this official\u2019s perception was that the CIA was \u201ccertainly\u201d exhibiting an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d about the Russia intelligence it was sending to the NSC, beginning around the time of Trump\u2019s impeachment proceedings. A whistleblower complaint about Trump from a CIA analyst, which Elwood relayed to NSC lawyer   at the time, is what sparked Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2014 feeding the mistrust toward Russia-related intelligence inside the White House and among the agency\u2019s top ranks. In 2016, Russia and China attacked American democracy by muddying the political discourse online. The virtual strikes marked one of the most direct interferences into American democracy by foreign actors in history. The heightened scrutiny within the CIA comes as the Justice Department, through prosecutor John Durham, continues to investigate the intelligence community\u2019s findings about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election \u2014 and   by Russia analysts that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered specifically to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy rather than just sow chaos. Trump, who has publicly railed against the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia interfered in 2016 to bolster his candidacy, has also been working to bring the intelligence community further under his control since his impeachment acquittal in February. He has installed loyalists in top positions like director of national intelligence and the senior-most  Current and former officials have said that in private, the president remains extraordinarily sensitive around the subject of Russian meddling \u2014 to the point where they hesitate to raise the topic. As recently as last Thursday, the president   his own FBI director on Twitter for testifying that Moscow was seeking to \u201csow divisiveness and discord\u201d and \u201cdenigrate Vice President Biden\u201d in a bid to influence the 2020 campaign.  \u201cScrutinizing intelligence product and process is exactly what is expected of Director Haspel not only because it\u2019s her job, it\u2019s her life\u2019s work \u2014 developing sources, vetting information, and checking assumptions \u2014 it\u2019s in her blood,\u201d said CIA press secretary Timothy Barrett. \u201cShe rightfully asks difficult questions and ensures intelligence is corroborated, double-checked, and then run through the wringer once more. Any suggestion of a political motive for how she leads this agency is misguided.\u201d  After this story was published, Barrett added: \u201cThe notion that the General Counsel or anyone else in senior leadership impedes analysis is laughable. Everyone who works here knows that analytic objectivity is beyond reproach.\u201d  Haspel\u2019s scrutiny of intelligence coming out of the CIA\u2019s Russia House has led to some recent dust-ups. The head of Russia House, whom officials declined to identify by name because they work undercover, was fired earlier this year, according to four of the current and former officials familiar with the matter, but remains at the agency in another mission center. It\u2019s not clear why he was ousted, but Haspel\u2019s personal dislike of him was clear. \u201cGina was not a fan,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the matter.  Another Russia House analyst quit earlier this year after Haspel accused him of lying about intelligence \u2014 an accusation that happens fairly often, several former officials said. \u201cShe calls analysts liars all the time,\u201d said one former CIA official. The head of the mission center itself is still in place. More recently, Haspel \u201ccompletely dismissed\u201d Russia House analysts who brought her intelligence showing a correlation between Russia and the curious phenomenon of diplomats experiencing brain trauma, according to one current U.S. official with knowledge of the episode. The brain trauma issue first came to light in 2017 when American and Canadian embassy staff in Cuba   of mysterious health problems that have never been definitively explained.  \u201cShe had a very defensive reaction, reacted very poorly and made some comments about needing to clean out Russia House,\u201d the official said.  Intelligence is a two-way process: Officials at the NSC and other \u201cconsumers\u201d in the government regularly send questions and requests to the intelligence community in what is known as a \u201ctasking,\u201d while \u201cproducers\u201d in America\u2019s spy agencies then try to provide answers. But the Russia portfolio at the NSC has faced constant churn over the past few years: Ryan Tully is the   to hold the senior director role, which previously had been held by Fiona Hill and Tim Morrison, both of whom testified in the impeachment inquiry. Joe Wang, who was deputy senior director for Europe and Russia at the NSC under Tully, left for the State Department over the summer. All that turnover \u201chas been hard on [Russia policy],\u201d another administration official said, \u201cbecause you need someone driving it who has a consistent view \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t seem like working on [Russia] has been a top priority.\u201d Critics of national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien say he has been prone to highlighting national security information and intelligence \u201cthat he knows the president will respond well to,\u201d as one former White House official put it. \u201cO\u2019Brien doesn\u2019t want anyone to touch things Russia-related because of the reaction,\u201d a second former White House official said. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat with Trump.\u201d An NSC spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment but an administration official pushed back and said: \u201cAnyone who\u2019s watched the NSC policy process over the last year knows how seriously the NSC has been working to counter Russian malign activities.\u201d Like other specialized units, Russia House \u2014 which remained highly compartmented even after it was integrated into the CIA\u2019s Mission Center for Europe and Eurasia as part of a reorganization under former CIA Director John Brennan \u2014 is extremely protective of its intelligence. But some within the agency, including Haspel, have described it as too isolated and in need of an overhaul, according to several of the current and former U.S. officials.  Others describe that characterization as unfair, and say a level of secrecy and limits on collaboration with other units is necessary to protect the information from being too widely shared or manipulated. \u201cWe thought her feeling that Russia House was cliquey or insular was grossly unfair,\u201d said a former senior CIA official. \u201cShe had preconceived notions about it, from her own time at the agency.\u201d Haspel joined the CIA in 1985 and spent nearly her entire career working undercover as a clandestine officer, serving as chief of station in Europe and Central Eurasia and focusing at times on Russian operations,  A daily briefing on politics and cybersecurity \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

That analysis was based at least in part on information   in the Kremlin, and is now at the center of Durham\u2019s probe. \u201cWhen I was there, Russia House was the most sensitive, most secretive organization in the building,\u201d said Larry Pfeiffer, who served as former CIA Director Michael Hayden\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cThey\u2019re very protective of the information, and rightfully so. Given Russian counterintelligence efforts, and the incredible sensitivity of any sources they might have, if something were to get out it could result in the loss of the life of an asset. And given what we know of Russian security efforts, I can only surmise that those assets are few and far between.\u201d  Some people familiar with Haspel\u2019s enhanced scrutiny of the Russia material say it isn\u2019t necessarily nefarious, or the result of her working to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces. One U.S. official acknowledged that while Haspel \u201chas been very demanding of anything Russia-related,\u201d it\u2019s possible that she just feels \u201cprotective\u201d of the agency she came up in. \u201cShe knows that they\u2019re under a microscope,\u201d this person said. \u201cSo she feels like they need to be more precise, and airtight.\u201d At least one CIA assessment likely to anger Trump   in the CIA\u2019s classified World Intelligence Review, which is disseminated to a wide array of policymakers and other stakeholders, on Aug. 31: that Putin was probably personally directing an ongoing operation to undermine Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy. Trump\u2019s firing of former acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who made the career-ending decision to allow a deputy to brief lawmakers on Russia\u2019s ongoing election interference, is still top of mind for many in the intelligence community who fear they could land in Trump\u2019s crosshairs if they challenge him in any official setting.  Those fears played out on Thursday night, when Trump went on a Twitter rampage against FBI Director Christopher Wray. Wray had testified during a public congressional hearing about Russia\u2019s ongoing attempts to undermine Biden \u2014 China is \u201ca FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia,\u201d   on Twitter \u2014 and the threat of white supremacist violence in the U.S. \u201cI look at them as a bunch of well funded ANARCHISTS & THUGS who are protected because the Comey/Mueller inspired FBI is simply unable, or unwilling, to find their funding source, and allows them to get away with \u201cmurder,\u2019\u201d Trump  Wray and other national security leaders, including Haspel, had specifically sought to avoid Trump\u2019s wrath earlier this year   the annual Worldwide Threats hearing before Congress be held behind closed doors and out of his sight.  Haspel\u2019s detractors say that approach has warped the agency\u2019s mandate to deliver its unvarnished assessments of world affairs, heedless of political considerations. \u201cThe director has abdicated her responsibility to tell the president what he needs to be told, and that is in part enabled by Elwood,\u201d said another former senior CIA official. This person said Elwood is \u201cin virtually every meeting, making decisions and getting involved in things that are not legal issues\u201d \u2014 including her role in reviewing all of the Russia-related material before it\u2019s sent out to the consumer, a job usually done, if necessary, by a unit\u2019s in-house lawyer.  Another former CIA official said Elwood showed \u201ca lot more interest\u201d in the agency\u2019s counterintelligence unit than previous general counsels, and had that unit\u2019s attorney begin reporting to her deputy. \u201cNo one is willing to challenge\u201d Elwood or Haspel, said the former senior CIA official. He added that Haspel\u2019s changes have \u201cbeen framed by some as an effort to \u2018protect the building\u2019 \u2014\u00a0well, her job is not to protect the building, it\u2019s to protect the country.\u201d "},

The 18-year-old Chechen accused of beheading a teacher near his school in a Paris suburb received asylum in France and had no links to Moscow, a Russian diplomat said. \"This crime has no relation to Russia because this person had lived in France for the past 12 years,\" the spokesman for the Russian embassy in Paris, Sergei Parinov, told state news agency TASS. It has also been reported that the teacher had been the target of online threats for having shown pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in class. The father of a schoolgirl had sought 47-year-old teacher Samuel Paty's dismissal and launched an online call for \"mobilisation\" against him after the lesson on freedom of expression, France's anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ricard said in a televised news conference. Paty was decapitated outside his school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, northwest of the capital, and the killer was fatally wounded by police. Ricard identified the attacker as Abdullakh A., an 18-year-old Chechen with refugee status in France. Nine people, including the schoolgirl's father, have so far been arrested. Ricard said the school received threats after the class in early October, which featured the controversial caricatures -- one of the prophet naked -- with the girl's father accusing Paty of disseminating \"pornography\".\u00a0 The girl and her father lodged a criminal complaint against the teacher, who in turn filed a complaint of defamation. The aggrieved father named Paty and gave the school's address in a social media post just days before the beheading, which President Emmanuel Macron has labelled an Islamist terror attack. Ricard did not say if the attacker had any links to the school, pupils or parents, or had acted independently in response to the online campaign. Witnesses said he was spotted at the school on Friday afternoon asking pupils where he could find Paty. The prosecutor said the attacker had been armed with a knife, an airgun and five canisters. He had fired shots at police and tried to stab them as they closed in on him. He was shot nine times. The attacker himself was not known to the French intelligence services, said the prosecutor. An investigation is under way into \"murder linked to a terrorist organisation\". On Saturday, hundreds of pupils, teachers and parents flooded to Paty's school to weep and lay white roses. Some carried placards stating: \"I am a teacher\" and \"I am Samuel\" -- echoing the \"I am Charlie\" cry that travelled around the world after the 2015 Charlie Hebdo killings. According to parents and teachers, Paty gave Muslim children the option to leave the classroom before he showed the cartoons, saying he did not want their feelings hurt. This was the second such attack since a trial started last month into the January 2015 massacre at the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine, which had published caricatures of the prophet that unleashed a wave of anger across the Islamic world. \n                                                                           \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                         \u00a9 1998-2019 Zee Media Corporation Ltd (An Essel Group Company), All\n                                    rights reserved.

In one example of the limited scope of distribution, the company financing the vaccine pointed to a shipment sent this past week to the Crimean Peninsula. The delivery contained doses for 21 people in a region with two million. The Russian Ministry of Health has not said how many people have been vaccinated in all of Russia. The minister, Mikhail Murashko, said last weekend that the first small shipments was being delivered this past week to the Russian provinces. He did not say how many doses were shipped, describing the shipments only as \u201csmall amounts,\u201d and also did not say when they would become available. He said the area around St. Petersburg, the Leningrad region, would be among the first to receive what he called \u201csamples\u201d of the vaccine. Mr. Putin has said that one of his two adult daughters took the vaccine. \u201cUnfortunately, we have very little information,\u201d said Dr. Vasily V. Vlassov, a professor of epidemiology and vice president of the Russian Association for Evidence-Based Medicine. His organization had opposed approval of the vaccine before testing it. \u201cWe cannot understand how much is P.R. and how much is a violation of medical ethics,\u201d he said of the announcement that the vaccine had been approved for use outside a clinical trial. If few Russians are receiving the vaccine, the early approval appears less troubling, he said. \u201cMaybe nothing scary is happening in reality and only the announcement was scary,\u201d he said. Svetlana Zavidova, the director of a pharmaceutical trade group, the Association of Clinical Trial Organizations, which also opposed the hasty approval, said the limited use was encouraging news, even as its reasons are unclear. \u201cIs it a question of limited production or more of a political decision?\u201d she said. Either way, \u201cof course from my point of view it is better they limit their activity to only clinical trials, as we said from the beginning.\u201d The trial in Russia began on Sept. 9, and Russian officials have said they expect early results before the end of the year, though the Gamaleya Institute, the scientific body that developed the vaccine, has scheduled the trial to continue until May. That timeline is similar to the testing schedules announced by the three pharmaceutical companies testing potential vaccines in the United States, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer.  this month after a test subject experienced symptoms of a neurological disease, transverse myelitis, as a possible side effect. The trial has since resumed in Britain but not the United States. Mr. Putin and senior health officials announced the approval of the Russian vaccine, called Sputnik V in reference to the satellite that won the space race, for emergency use on Aug. 11. China had earlier begun vaccinations outside trials  , and has approved four vaccines for limited use. On Sept. 14, the United Arab Emirates  , for use on health workers. Russia\u2019s health minister said on Aug. 11 that people at high risk of infection, like doctors and teachers, would be vaccinated, and the Russian financial company sponsoring the vaccine said doses would be available in August. Mr. Murashko, the minister, said the delays were partly because of a need to test the distribution system for a vaccine that must be stored in a deep freeze, and also to train medical personnel. The delays have persisted even as the virus  The Russian late-stage, or Phase 3, clinical trial is being carried out entirely in Moscow, where 30,000 people will receive the vaccine and 10,000 will get a placebo. Yevgenia Zubova, a spokeswoman for the Moscow city health department, said in an interview that the vaccine was available only to trial participants. The Health Ministry did not reply to written questions about the use of the Sputnik V vaccine outside clinical trials. Nonetheless, Kirill Dmitriev, the director of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the company sponsoring the vaccine, has been cheering on officials in other countries who advocate early vaccine approvals. \u201cIt has now been accepted that Russia\u2019s approach is the correct one,\u201d he said in a statement after reports emerged that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration might provide an emergency use approval for a vaccine, an idea promoted by President Trump. Russia\u2019s health authorities have a history of approving medicines after limited testing. It is a legacy of the Soviet-era regulatory system, in which an oversight committee often deferred to the judgment of drug researchers, who were not motivated by profit, said Dr. Vlassov with the Association for Evidence-Based Medicine. Regulators have, for example, approved a best-selling cold medicine in Russia, Arbidol, though the clinical trial to prove its efficacy was canceled. But when medicines are tested, Russia has an exceptionally good track record on managing clinical trials, according to a database of U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections of clinical trials around the world. The F.D.A. found a lower percentage of trials with problems in Russia than in any other European country or the United States. "},

Icebreakers are particularly important to Russia, the only country in the world with more than 2 million citizens living above the Arctic Circle.

Icebreakers can also rescue other ships trapped in encroaching ice. In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin   the country would ultimately have a fleet of 13 icebreakers, the majority of them nuclear-powered.

Ships traveling the Northern Sea Route would spend   fewer days at sea than ships sailing to the same destination via the Suez Canal, making it a compelling (but colder) alternative.

{"text": "After a farewell tour with his band, Leningrad, Sergei Shnurov switched tracks with a day job running a respectable but dull television station. MOSCOW \u2014 For nearly two decades, he was Russia\u2019s most popular, highest-earning and, to his critics, most cynical rock star. Celebrated by millions for his foul-mouthed lyrics and gritty authenticity, he packed stadiums across the country while raking in extra cash from small private concerts for Kremlin-friendly tycoons. \u201cYes, I am a cynic. This is a philosophical and clinical school. It is a diagnosis,\u201d said Sergei Shnurov, the longtime frontman for the ska-punk band Leningrad. \u201cFrom my point of view, we definitely do not have enough sober cynicism.\u201d But after what was billed as   last year\u00a0\u2014 all sold-out \u2014 Mr. Shnurov, 47, has shocked even his usually unshockable public. He changed his wardrobe, dropping sleeveless undershirts and baggy shorts in favor of office wear; left St. Petersburg, his beloved hometown; and started work behind a tidy desk in Moscow as the newly appointed general producer of RTVI, a rather bland, family-friendly television station that frowns upon on-air swearing. He is even trying to quit smoking. Before taking the job, he almost never watched TV and had not owned a television set for more than a decade. State channels, he said, are mostly unwatchable festivals of propaganda, and anything interesting can be found on the internet. The station, established in 1997 by the since exiled oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky and now privately owned by a Soviet \u00e9migr\u00e9 who lives in California, aims its programing at Russian speakers in the United States, Israel and Europe. It has \u201cno connection whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Shnurov said, to  He said he would like to change the name to avoid any association in people\u2019s minds with  , which he said was set up later and \u201cstole\u201d the name. RT, he added, \u201cis a propaganda channel, absolutely\u201d and has given his station\u2019s brand a bad name. His transformation is an abrupt shift for a rocker whose songs include classics like \u201c \u201d a celebration of St. Petersburg\u2019s taste for booze and the intoxicants favored in other Russian cities, and feature so many profanities that he has been taken to court on obscenity charges. (He avoided conviction by arguing that the curses are an essential part of his artistic oeuvre and not aimed at offending anyone in particular.) His breakthrough album, released in 1999 \u2014 shortly before Vladimir V. Putin, also from St. Petersburg, became Russia\u2019s president \u2014 was called \u201cCursing Without Electricity.\u201d For his many critics in Russia\u2019s liberal opposition who have long viewed the star as a greedy opportunist, his latest metamorphosis is just another step along what the prominent actor and theater director Evgeny Grishkovets has described as a long journey from \u201crock \u2019n\u2019 roll pirate\u201d to \u201ccynical businessman who despises his own public.\u201d Mr. Shnurov responded to the director\u2019s damning judgment as he does to many things: He wrote a sardonic poem and  And whatever liberal Moscow intellectuals might think of him, Mr. Shnurov, whom most Russians know simply as \u201cShnur,\u201d can be confident that he retains a far bigger following across the country than all of them put together. This is due largely to his pioneering work in what became a hugely popular genre of Russian narrative music videos that combine slick production with catchy tunes and story lines that speak to the hopes and frustrations of so many Russians.  about a young woman preparing in the grungy apartment she shares with her mother for a date with a wealthy suitor, has been viewed more than 164 million times on YouTube. A teenager in St. Petersburg in the late 1980s as the Soviet Union was falling apart, he moved between two very different worlds: a rebellious music scene that worshiped Viktor Tsoi, a fellow St. Petersburg singer whose song   became the anthem of a generation; and Mr. Shnurov\u2019s parents, engineers who worked in the Soviet defense sector. His mother had a job in a secret enterprise that made computers, his father in one that produced communications gear. His grandfather was a highly decorated Soviet officer, and the family, though not wealthy, had an apartment in the center of St. Petersburg, which was then known as Leningrad. The Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, Mr. Shnurov said, came as a shock to everyone, even those desperate for change, replacing \u201cromantic illusions\u201d with vast new vistas of opportunity clouded by cynical calculation. \u201cIn my life, even money has changed five times. Money always seemed to be something that should last forever,\u201d he said. \u201cYour own identity changes, and you become a different person.\u201d His knack for moving with the times has left him with a reputation in opposition circles as a sellout who always goes with the flow. This is particularly the case among supporters of  , the anticorruption campaigner who was   after what Germany says was a poisoning attack with  Asked about Mr. Navalny in an interview shortly before the attack, Mr. Shnurov derided the opposition leader as the \u201cmirror image\u201d of Mr. Putin, dismissing him as a cultlike figure who brooks no dissent and demands support as a \u201cmatter of faith\u201d disconnected from any concrete policy proposals.  last month, however, Mr. Shnurov swiftly revised his views. In  , he lamented that \u201cdeath is everywhere in the form of poison\u201d and that the sinister habits of \u201cComrade Chekist\u201d\u00a0\u2014 a reference to former K.G.B. officers like Mr. Putin \u2014 \u201cwould make the Medicis jealous.\u201d Mr. Shnurov has never rated consistency as a virtue. \u201cThe whole world today has become a carnival \u2014 everything is theatrical,\u201d he said, noting that Russians who one day watch state television will the next day watch videos denouncing the Kremlin on Mr. Navalny\u2019s YouTube channel. He is vague about why he moved into television, beyond saying that he wanted a change after more than two exhausting decades as a hard-drinking rocker. The move also followed a big rupture in his personal life with the collapse in 2018 of his marriage and his swift remarriage to a new wife, his fourth. Artemy Troitsky, a former music critic and concert promoter who was a friend of Mr. Shnurov\u2019s until they fell out after the rocker made disparaging comments about protests led by Mr. Navalny in 2011 and 2012, said he was mystified by Mr. Shnurov\u2019s career change. One possible reason, he said, is that Leningrad has been losing steam in recent years, so \u201cnow he is trying some new tricks.\u201d \u201cHaving known him well for many years, both publicly and privately, I don\u2019t trust this guy,\u201d Mr. Troitsky said. \u201cHe is extremely talented but also extremely cynical, and despite singing songs loaded with F-words he has always known how to make money and play it safe.\u201d So far, however, Mr. Shnurov has been rocking the boat in his new job. One of his first projects has been to travel to   to make a documentary about a  . There was widespread suspicion that he had been sent there by the Kremlin, but he insists that was not the case, and the program he produced is unlikely to have found favor among Russian officials. After this came an investigation by RTVI into the cause of protests in the Bashkiria region. It featured environmental activists standing their ground and defeating wealthy business interests, government officials and the security forces. State-controlled television, by contrast, has blanketed the protests in Khabarovsk and Bashkiria in silence, which explains why a recent opinion survey found that 62 percent of Russians were not even aware there had been any protests. RTVI does not have a license to broadcast inside Russia, but its shows can all be viewed on the internet. Another of Mr. Shnurov\u2019s projects is to recruit more edgy journalists to the channel. He said he had been trying to hire  , who did groundbreaking reporting on criminal infiltration of the funeral business in cahoots with the security officials and was subsequently  His biggest hire so far, however, has been Tina Kandelaki, a prominent TV presenter and entrepreneur who is better known as a glamorous style icon than as a hard-hitting journalist. Mr. Shnurov said he was delighted when Mr. Putin first took power at the end of 1999, mostly because his move to the Kremlin scored a big win for St. Petersburg in its long struggle with Moscow over which city is more important, but also because the leader \u201coffered a new chance\u201d for Russia after a decade of false starts under President Boris N. Yeltsin. But he has grown disenchanted. Today, he said, Mr. Putin \u201crepresents just a fog.\u201d \u2018\u2018The system must change,\u201d Mr. Shnurov said. \u201cThe system must always change. If something does not change, then it will be changed.\u201d "},

Turkey has already taken possession of the S-400 and is unlikely to give up the extremely expensive piece of hardware, analysts say. And although Congress has urged the imposition of sanctions on Ankara, President Donald Trump has so far been reluctant to levy them. It\u2019s unclear whether this latest incident would change Washington\u2019s calculus. Under a 2017 law known in Washington by its acronym, CAATSA, the U.S. must impose sanctions on governments that conclude a major defense purchase from Russia.. Lawmakers insist that the S-400 deal meets that definition. \u201cIf they're turning the S-400 on, they're probably using it in some way,\u201d said Thomas Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. \u201cBut use isn\u2019t the criterion for CAATSA sanctions. \u201cThe burden of proof is not to establish the \u2018improper\u2019 use \u2014 say, towards fellow NATO allies,\u201d Karako said. \u201cThe CAATSA language is about taking delivery of arms from Russia.\u201d The State Department spokesman did not rule out the use of CAATSA.\u00a0 \u201cWe continue to object strenuously to Turkey\u2019s purchase of the S-400 air defense system, and are deeply concerned with reports that Turkey is continuing its efforts to bring the S-400 into operation,\u201d the State department spokesman said. \u201cWe continue to stress at the highest levels that the S-400 transaction remains a major obstacle in the bilateral relationship and at NATO, as well as a risk for potential CAATSA sanctions.\u201d\u00a0 The department is \u201cconfident that President Erdogan and his senior officials understand our position.\u201d Still, the alleged incident would suggest Ankara is moving ahead with its implementation of the system. An S-400 battery is made up of a command post, missile launchers, and a powerful radar that can spot and track multiple objects simultaneously from hundreds of miles away. \u201cRadars don't just sit and stare. In surveillance mode, they're casting about to see if anything pops up,\u201d Karako said. \u201cBut when they find something, they're going to put more energy on the target and track it.\u201d For Turkey, the alleged episode is likely less about NATO and the United States than it is about its long-running dispute with Greece. Erdogan may also be banking on a muscular foreign policy posture to take Turks\u2019 minds off the struggling Turkish economy and its increasingly autocratic leader. Over the summer, tempers have flared between the neighbors over access to gas reserves in the Mediterranean, heightening tensions over the divided island of Cyprus and the crossing of migrants from Turkey into Greece. Pompeo visited Greece, Crete, and Cyprus in September, during which he explicitly backed Cyprus and Greece in their jurisdictional dispute over maritime rights.\u00a0 \u201cWe remain deeply concerned by Turkey\u2019s ongoing operations surveying for natural resources in areas over which Greece and Cyprus assert jurisdiction in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Republic of Cyprus has the right to exploit its natural resources, including the right to hydrocarbons found in its territorial sea and its economic \u2013 exclusive economic zone,\u201d Pompeo   in prepared remarks on Sept. 12. \u201cWe also believe that the resources of Cyprus should be shared equitably among the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots communities.\u201d The U.S. relationship with Turkey has become   over the past two years. Although the standoff over the S-400 has been the central issue, Erdogan\u2019s October 2019 incursion into Syria also created a major rift between the two NATO allies. Some analysts and lawmakers have   that Turkey\u2019s purchase of the S-400 shows it is moving away from the U.S. and the rest of NATO, and towards Russia \u2014 or, relatedly, that Russia is using existing fissures in the relationship to try to cleave Turkey away from NATO. Still others   that Turkey is only doing what it has always done: make tactical and strategic decisions based on what it considered its best interests. But inside the executive branch, officials are keenly aware of the cost of a deeper split with Turkey. The stakes include access to several key U.S. and NATO sites. Incirlik Air Base hosts American B-61 nuclear gravity bombs, and is a friendly jumping-off point into the Middle East. Turkey also controls the Bosphorus, which under a 1936 agreement means it controls naval access to and from the Black Sea.\u00a0  \u2014 say that the alleged use of the system is proof that the Trump administration has been too soft on Turkey.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a far cry from maximum pressure, and from getting allies to do the right thing,\u201d Karako\u00a0said. \u201cThe price of the administration\u2019s failure to impose sanctions has now become increasingly more apparent.\u201d \n             \n             \n               \n           Help us tailor content specifically for you: "},

WASHINGTON \u2014 The military said on Friday that it was sending Bradley fighting vehicles, advanced radar and more fighter jet patrols to northeast Syria, three weeks after   an American ground patrol and injured seven American soldiers. The reinforcements, which add about 100 troops to the more than 500 U.S. forces already there, represent a show of force in response to the clash last month that caught American commanders off guard. They are also likely to escalate tensions between the two rival powers in the country\u2019s hotly contested northeast. \u201cThese actions are a clear demonstration of U.S. resolve to defend coalition forces,\u201d Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the military\u2019s Central Command, said in an email, \u201cand to ensure that they are able to continue their defeat-ISIS mission without interference.\u201d The new deployment came on the same day that President Trump declared that American troops \u201care out of Syria,\u201d except to guard the region\u2019s oil fields. \u201cOther than that, we are out of Syria,\u201d Mr. Trump said at White House news conference, making no mention of what the Pentagon says is the main mission there: to help its Syrian Kurdish allies fight remnants of the Islamic State. The deployment includes a handful of Bradley fighting vehicles \u2014 the same that were   \u2014 as well as Sentinel radars to track Russian helicopters, and increased fighter jet and Apache helicopter gunship patrols to support American ground forces. It has been in the works since the altercation in Syria revealed the latest Russian test of American military  Democrats immediately seized on the episode as the latest example of Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to challenge Russia\u2019s increasing aggressions toward the West, including interfering in this year\u2019s general election and  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, in a speech in Pennsylvania on Aug. 31, rebuked Mr. Trump for failing to publicly address the altercation in Syria: \u201cDid you hear the president say a single word? Did he lift one finger?\u201d The latest trouble started on Aug. 25 during what the Pentagon called a   on highways in the region, breaking agreements between the two countries to steer clear of each other, American officials say. The United States   last fall before a Turkish cross-border offensive.  that later emerged on Twitter appeared to show Russian and American vehicles speeding in an open field, with a Russian vehicle smashing into an American vehicle, and two Russian helicopters buzzing low over U.S. forces uncontested by American air power. The skirmish set off a war of words and finger-pointing between the two sides. A White House spokesman called the Russian actions \u201cunsafe and unprofessional\u201d and a violation of a December 2019 agreement to avoid clashes on the ground.   criticized the White House response as woefully inadequate. The next day, Pentagon and U.S. Central Command officials issued tougher statements, condemning the Russian action. Seven American soldiers were treated for concussionlike symptoms at their base in Syria and returned to duty soon after. The U.S. military\u2019s account contrasted sharply with the Russian version of events. In a phone call with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shortly after the episode, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the Russian chief of the general staff, said that American troops tried to block a Russian patrol \u201cin breach of the existing agreements,\u201d according to  General Gerasimov told General Milley that U.S. troops tried to block the Russian patrol, which \u201ctook every step necessary to prevent the incident and proceed with its mission,\u201d a characterization American officials rejected.  last week with The New York Times and two other news organizations, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of the Central Command, continued to blame the Russians. \u201cThey were in an area they were not supposed to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not in an area that they had received permission to go to. And their actions were frankly reckless at the tactical level.\u201d General McKenzie said American officers in the middle of the fray prevented an escalation. No shots were fired. \u201cWhat saved the situation was the very good judgment of small unit U.S. Army commanders on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I got those kind of people out there making decisions.\u201d General McKenzie said in another interview last week that tensions with the Russians in Syria had eased for the moment, but he foreshadowed the reinforcements announced on Friday. \u201cTheir behavior has been better,\u201d he  . \u201cI don\u2019t want to judge or project what it might be in the future. But I would simply tell you that we are ready for all eventualities in Syria and the force has what it needs to protect itself.\u201d "},
{"text": "As part of their attempt to interfere with the 2020 election, Russians are grabbing screenshots of President Trump\u2019s tweets, or quoting his own misleading statements, analysts and officials say. WASHINGTON \u2014 Four years ago, when   intelligence agencies engaged in a systematic attempt to influence the American presidential election, the disinformation they fed American voters required some real imagination at the troll farms producing the ads. There was the exaggerated Texas secession movement, a famous ad in which   while declaring, \u201cIf I win, Clinton wins,\u201d and an effort to recruit protesters and counterprotesters to the same, invented rally over the rapid spread of Islamic influence in the United States. This year, their task is much easier. They are largely amplifying misleading statements from President Trump, mostly about the dangers of mail-in ballots. In interviews, a range of officials and private analysts said that Mr. Trump was feeding many of the disinformation campaigns they were struggling to halt. And rather than travel the back roads of America searching for divisive issues \u2014 as three   from the Internet Research Agency did in 2016 \u2014 they are staying home, grabbing screenshots of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts, or quoting his misleading statements and then amplifying those messages. That campaign is at the heart of the disinformation efforts that the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray,   was meant \u201cto both sow divisiveness and discord\u201d and \u201cto denigrate\u201d former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. Mr. Trump chastised him for his comments on Twitter. \u201cBut Chris, you don\u2019t see any activity from China, even though it is a FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia,\u201d he said. He went on to repeat the kind of statements the Russians have been exploiting, writing that the two countries would take advantage of \u201cour totally vulnerable Unsolicited (Counterfeit?) Ballot Scam.\u201d Twitter flagged the president\u2019s tweet, urging readers to click on a link to \u201clearn how voting by mail is safe and secure.\u201d The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday again warned of the risk of interference in the election, this time by foreigners aiming to exploit the time it will take to sort through mail-in ballots. During that time, the agencies said, hackers could amplify \u201cdisinformation that includes reports of voter suppression, cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud and other problems intended to convince the public of the elections\u2019 illegitimacy.\u201d The warning made no mention that the president had recently listed several of those techniques as likely to plague the vote. Multiple U.S. officials with access to the intelligence have said Mr. Trump has been doing the job of the Russian propagandists for them. Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser when he was vice president, Antony J. Blinken, charged at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce forum on Tuesday that as a \u201cleading consumer and purveyor of conspiracy theories,\u201d Mr. Trump \u201cseems to have suited up for the other side.\u201d Clint Watts, a former F.B.I. special agent and a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said his review of the disinformation traffic showed that \u201cthe Russians in 2016 had to make false news stories or manipulated truths to power their narratives.\u201d \u201cThis time they\u2019re not writing anything that\u2019s not already said in U.S. space,\u201d often by Mr. Trump himself, Mr. Watts added. \u201cThey must be flabbergasted and saying, \u2018We really don\u2019t need to work hard this time.\u2019\u201d Much of the Russian traffic echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to establish an argument for rejecting the election results if he loses in states that are mailing ballots to all voters for the first time. But of the states doing so for the first time this election, only Nevada is seriously in contention. No sooner did Mr. Trump begin to contend that the system was ridden with fraud than Russian trolls, bots and news sites joined in. In late May, the state-backed Russian website RT was quick to publish an article claiming that such ballots \u201care the easiest route to a RIGGED ELECTION.\u201d By early August, the Strategic Culture Foundation \u2014 an online journal that the State Department declared recently \u201cis directed by Russian Foreign Intelligence Service\u201d \u2014 had  , according to analysts at Recorded Future, a group based in Somerville, Mass., that analyzes cyberactivity by foreign governments. An article appearing on the Strategic Culture website concludes: \u201cPresident Trump has several times claimed that the expected surge in mail-in voting could result in \u2018 .\u2019 Trump is often wrong when he speaks or tweets spontaneously, but this time he just might be right.\u201d And this month, the Russian government news site, Sputnik, published an article headlined, \u201cTrump Again Claims Biden May Be Using Drugs to Enhance His Debate Performances,\u201d repeating comments the president made on Fox News. That piece was republished by the right-wing website Infowars, disseminating it more widely in the United States, and readers shared it on social media. That allowed the article to spread without running the risk that it would be removed because it was an \u201cinauthentic\u201d post by a Russian troll in St. Petersburg pretending to be American. The Russia proxy website Newsfront went further, reporting \u201cconfirmation of rumors about Biden\u2019s incapacity.\u201d It is the exact type of disinformation a homeland security intelligence bulletin warned Russian actors have amplified \u201cbecause they judge this narrative will resonate with some American voters and reduce their confidence in him as a candidate.\u201d Feeding the Russian desire to discredit the election system was also what the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee   on how Moscow tried to manipulate the 2016 election. \u201cSitting officials and candidates should use the absolute greatest amount of restraint and caution if they are considering calling the validity of an upcoming election into question,\u201d the committee concluded, without dissent from its Republican majority. \u201cSuch a grave allegation can have significant national security and electoral consequences, including limiting the response options of the appropriate authorities, and exacerbating the already damaging messaging efforts of foreign intelligence services.\u201d Now, his own bureaucracy finds itself stuck between their intelligence findings and an angry president. The day before Mr. Trump scolded his F.B.I. director on Twitter, General Paul M. Nakasone, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, warned of the dangers of Russian disinformation \u2014 which his agency has pledged to counter. General Nakasone has vowed to take steps to knock such disinformation offline, as he did in the 2018 midterm elections, when Cyber Command attacked the Internet Research Agency, the digital propaganda shop that operates from St. Petersburg, disabling its systems for a number of days. One veteran of Cyber Command noted that the general\u2019s mission in the next six weeks may involve taking down Russian posts that are quoting his boss. Intelligence officials, for their part, are battling an effort by Mr. Trump and his top advisers to cast China and Iran as equal threats to the election, which runs counter to their intelligence. A homeland security official, Brian Murphy,   that the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security, including the agency\u2019s acting secretary Chad F. Wolf, blocked the release of a threat assessment that contained warnings of Russian interference because of how it \u201cwould reflect upon President Trump.\u201d The senior officials instead directed analysts to highlight threats posed by China and Iran, which have generally targeted Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Murphy. While both are threats, officials say, their operations are neither as extensive nor as sophisticated as the Russians. They are longer-term concerns, though Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, has sought to portray them on equal footing with Moscow. Former officials say they are concerned that such contradictory assessments play into Russia\u2019s hands. \u201cIf the adversary\u2019s goal is to undermine confidence in the legitimacy of the process, then it\u2019s incredibly important we have voices to counter that objective,\u201d said Suzanne Spaulding, a former under secretary for cybersecurity and critical infrastructure at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cAnd if the credibility of those voices has been undermined, then it makes the adversary\u2019s jobs that much easier.\u201d In a draft of the assessment from August, homeland security analysts wrote: \u201cRussia probably will be the primary covert influence actor and purveyor of disinformation and misinformation within the homeland.\u201d They continued, \u201cWe assess that Moscow\u2019s primary objective is to increase its global standing and influence by weakening America \u2014 domestically and abroad \u2014 through efforts to sow discord, distract, shape public sentiment and undermine trust in Western democratic institutions and processes.\u201d Mr. Murphy said he learned in September that Mr. Wolf had ordered new drafts to be redesigned by his policy office. Mr. Wolf\u2019s department has now said it will be released on Oct. 1. The Department of Homeland Security has rejected Mr. Murphy\u2019s allegations. Mr. Wolf has seldom highlighted the Russian threat in public remarks without also mentioning China and Iran. Harry Fones, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency had tracked a growing threat from Russia, China and Iran. \u201cAs a department it is our duty to defend our nation and critical infrastructure like elections from all threats, not just the one the news is focusing on,\u201d he said.

{"text": "The giant hogweed isn\u2019t just an invasive plant. It\u2019s a metaphor for what is happening to much of this country. Ms. Antonova is a journalist and science writer. BALASHIKHA, Russia \u2014 Take any of the many highways out of the Russian capital and you can dissect the country\u2019s strata like rings on a tree. Sentinel apartment towers replace the bustling illuminated center, then the belt of auto dealerships and box stores drifts by. Gradually, the landscape becomes sparse, with villages and towns sporadically punctuating the stretch of meadows and forests for thousands of miles in every direction. Russia is the biggest country on Earth and both the state and the people take pride in the size of its territory \u2014 \u201cfrom the southern seas to the polar fringes,\u201d as the current national anthem goes. That quiet emptiness, the enormousness of Russia, has been infiltrated in recent decades by an alien force: the giant hogweed. This invader, an exceptionally tall plant with a toxic sap that can cause third-degree burns and blindness, has come to symbolize the fate of rural Russia: malign neglect by the government. While Russia may be vast, most economic activity \u2014 and much of life in general \u2014 is concentrated in a handful of cities. And after various Soviet-era attempts to develop land through centralized planning, there is evidence that the current government is doing the exact opposite. Enter the hogweed. In the summer, the giant hogweed assumes the look of dill on steroids; its coffee-table sized leaves create thickets impossible to pass without a hazmat suit. In the winter, it desiccates into a brown skeleton. Outside Moscow, the hogweeds are often the only visible landmarks over white fields, ominous umbrellas standing in the snow like War of the Worlds troops poised to march. Officials have begun to refer to overgrown areas as \u201ccontaminated.\u201d Giant hogweeds grow naturally in the Caucasus Mountains. Evolving to thrive on shifting soils, they compete with other high-altitude herbage by yielding extraordinary seed counts \u2014 up to 100,000 per plant. The plant\u2019s Latin name, Heracleum, hints at its extraordinary strength. In Central Russia, where typical meadow grasses are much shorter, it quickly overpowers all local species. \u201cOur plants cannot compete with it,\u201d Dmitry Geltman, the director of the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told me. \u201cIt takes over deserted fields because it likes unstable soil. For any alien species, it is easier to infiltrate a fluctuating community.\u201d Mr. Geltman speaks in botanical terms, but he could be talking about life in rural Russia, which has experienced a relentless population exodus since the 1990s. Russia has some 222 million hectares of agricultural land, nearly 100 million of which are unused, according to a 2016 census. Much of this vast territory \u2014 386,000 square miles, about twice the size of Spain \u2014 was abandoned after the breakup of the Soviet Union because it was unprofitable to farm. As humans left, the hogweed advanced. It seems the government doesn\u2019t know what to do with the land, or the people on it: Rural Russians are twice as poor and jobless as those living in urban areas. Research has shown that the number of farms in the country halved between 2006 and 2016. The top 1 percent of all agricultural companies receive two-thirds of all investment \u2014 just 61 companies collectively own over 14 million hectares of farmland and prefer to use seasonal migrant labor. Rural Russians are shut out of economic opportunity. Vasily Melnichenko, a straight-talking farmer from the Ural Mountains who heads a movement for rural development, says President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government\u2019s policy toward rural Russia has been awful. Rural people are seen as a \u201cburden,\u201d he said, sapping budget funding for roads, electricity and health care. \u201cIt has gone on too long to be a mistake, but if it\u2019s done on purpose, then that would mean we\u2019re governed by enemies,\u201d Mr. Melnichenko told me. \u201cThere have been dozens of road maps and national projects, but nobody can carry them out. There is a complete inability to understand the territory.\u201d Another 20 years of the same, he said, and all the remaining residents will die out, ending the Russian village as a form of life. The giant hogweed is what happens when a land loses its stewards. The weed is expanding its coverage by about 10 percent every year. It now creeps to the margins of forests and rivers, even near urban areas. Even the heavily built-up Moscow region had almost 270 square miles contaminated with giant hogweed this summer, according to the regional government. In the Tver region, which lies between Moscow and St. Petersburg and is the size of Austria, the hogweed has permeated a third of towns and villages. The invasion is one of the many environmental disasters brought on by Soviet centralized planning. After World War II, Soviet agronomists, keen to quickly rebuild the country\u2019s agriculture industry, thought that the plant\u2019s impressive biomass could make it a good crop to feed livestock. Seeds were distributed throughout the country. Hogweed contains a high concentration of furanocoumarins, substances that cause severe burns and blisters when affected areas of skin are exposed to sunlight. Even so, the plant was grown nationwide. By the 1980s, when the plant began infiltrating central Russia\u2019s wilderness, tests showed that cows fed on hogweed produced poor-tasting milk. Efforts to make the plant less toxic failed. The plague could not be contained. While some regional governments now try to spray problem zones with pesticides, Moscow hasn\u2019t paid the problem any attention or sought to understand its scope. Tatarstan, the only region to monitor its spread, has pleaded for federal help, saying that the area overtaken by the hogweed grew tenfold in the past eight years, with thousands of burn victims and even fatalities. Some activists and scientists are experimenting with solutions, ranging from hogweed-eating snails to moonshine production. One evening I joined an activist, Maria Popova, on a hogweed raid outside the Russian capital. We equipped ourselves with gloves, goggles and large kitchen knives on the edge of a field that is part of the popular Losiny Ostrov National Park \u2014 a large nature area close to Moscow. \u201cIf you don\u2019t interfere, the hogweeds multiply at a crazy rate and soon there is nothing but them,\u201d she said as we hiked through the tall grass. Ms. Popova started patrolling the nearby fields when she came across \u201cplantations\u201d of hogweed on one of her walks. The national park, which is tasked with protecting biodiversity, has ignored the problem, she said. She called hogweed \u201ca symbol of neglect.\u201d \u201cAt the national level, the government does nothing,\u201d she said, rising up on tiptoes and hacking off giant umbrella-like flowering structures on stalks three meters in the air. It\u2019s a trustworthy method to prevent the weed from seeding \u2014 one activist in a hogweed-fighting social networking group confessed to arming herself with a machete on cycling trips. But urban activists are more likely to mobilize online, while in the provinces, there simply aren\u2019t enough people who care, said Darya Grebenshchikova, a writer living in a shrinking village in Tver region. \u201cThe hogweed is not perceived as a problem because there is no population here to perceive it as a problem,\u201d she told me. \u201cI have lost hope in some kind of renaissance of the village. The government has decided it\u2019s too much hassle to keep the rural areas alive, so they are turning it into a desert.\u201d ) is a Russian journalist who writes on science and culture. "},
{"text": "He chronicled Stalin\u2019s tyrannies and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he was an enthusiastic admirer of Mikhail Gorbachev. Stephen F. Cohen, an eminent historian whose books and commentaries on Russia examined the rise and fall of Communism, Kremlin dictatorships and the emergence of a post-Soviet nation still struggling for identity in the 21st century, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81.  His wife, Katrina vanden Heuvel, the publisher and part owner of The Nation, said the cause was lung cancer. From the sprawling conflicts of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution and the tyrannies of Stalin to the collapse of the Soviet Union and Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s intrigues to retain power, Professor Cohen chronicled a Russia of sweeping social upheavals and the passions and poetry of peoples that endured a century of wars, political repression and economic hardships. A professor emeritus of Russian studies at Princeton University and New York University, he was fluent in Russian, visited Russia frequently and developed contacts among intellectual dissidents and government and Communist Party officials. He wrote or edited 10 books and many articles for The Nation, The New York Times and other publications, was a CBS-TV commentator and counted President George Bush and many American and Soviet officials among his sources. In Moscow he was befriended by the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who invited him to the May Day celebration at Red Square in 1989. There, at the Lenin Mausoleum, Professor Cohen stood with his wife and son one tier below Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership to view a three-hour military parade. He later spoke briefly on Russian television to a vast audience about alternative paths that Russian history could have taken. Loosely identified with a revisionist historical view of the Soviet Union, Professor Cohen held views that made him a controversial public intellectual. He believed that early Bolshevism had held great promise, that it had been democratic and genuinely socialist, and that it had been corrupted only later by civil war, foreign hostility, Stalin\u2019s malignancy and a fatalism in Russian history. A traditionalist school of thought, by contrast, held that the Soviet experiment had been flawed from the outset, that Lenin\u2019s political vision was totalitarian, and that any attempt to create a society based on his coercive utopianism had always been likely to lead, logically, to Stalin\u2019s state terrorism and to the Soviet Union\u2019s eventual collapse. Professor Cohen was an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Gorbachev, who after coming to power in 1985 undertook ambitious changes to liberate the nation\u2019s 15 republics from state controls that had originally been imposed by Stalin. Mr. Gorbachev gave up power as the Soviet state imploded at the end of 1991 and moved toward beliefs in democracy and a market economy. A prolific writer who mined Soviet archives, Professor Cohen first came to international attention in 1973 with \u201cBukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution,\u201d a biography of Lenin\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nikolai Bukharin, who envisioned Communism as a blend of state-run industries and free-market agriculture. Critics generally applauded the work, which was a finalist for a National Book Award. \u201cStephen Cohen\u2019s full-scale study of Bukharin is the first major study of this remarkable associate of Lenin,\u201d   in The Times. \u201cAs such it constitutes a milestone in Soviet studies, the byproduct both of increased academic sophistication in the use of Soviet materials and also of the very substantial increase in basic information which has become available in the 20 years since Stalin\u2019s death.\u201d After Lenin\u2019s death, Mr. Bukharin became a victim of Stalin\u2019s Moscow show trials in 1938; he was accused of plotting against Stalin and executed. His widow, Anna Mikhailovna Larina, spent 20 years in exile and in prison camps and campaigned for Mr. Bukharin\u2019s rehabilitation, which was endorsed by Mr. Gorbachev in 1988. Ms. Larina and Professor Cohen became friends. Given access to Bukharin archives, he found and returned to her the last love letter that Mr. Bukharin wrote her from prison. In \u201cRethinking the Soviet Experience\u201d (1985), Professor Cohen offered a new interpretation of the nation\u2019s traumatic history and modern political realities. In his view, Stalin\u2019s despotism and Mr. Bukharin\u2019s fate were not necessarily inevitable outgrowths of the party dictatorship founded by Lenin. Richard Lowenthal, in a review for The Times, called Professor Cohen\u2019s interpretation implausible. \u201cWhile I do not believe that all the horrors of Stalinism were \u2018logically inevitable\u2019 consequences of the seizure of power by Lenin and his Bolshevik Party,\u201d Mr. Lowenthal wrote, \u201cI do believe that Stalin\u2019s victory over Bukharin was inherent in the structure of the party\u2019s system.\u201d As Professor Cohen and other scholars pondered Russia\u2019s past, Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s rise to power and his efforts toward glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) cast the future of the Soviet Union in a new light, potentially reversing 70 years of Cold War dogma. As Mr. Gorbachev arrived in Washington for his 1987 summit with President Ronald Reagan, The Times wrote, \u201cWith an irreverence for precedent and an agility uncommon in Soviet leaders, he has disrupted old assumptions about Soviet impulses, forced reappraisals of Soviet purposes and rendered less predictable the course of East-West competition.\u201d To widen the focus, Professor Cohen and  published \u201cVoices of Glasnost: Interviews With Gorbachev\u2019s Reformers\u201d (1989). Professor Cohen affirmed his support for Mr. Gorbachev in a March 1991 Op-Ed article in The Times. \u201cHe has undertaken the most ambitious changes in modern history,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTheir goal is to dismantle the state controls Stalin imposed and to achieve an emancipation of society through privatization, democratization and federalization of the 15 republics.\u201d As 1991 ended, the Soviet Union was dissolved and Mr. Gorbachev resigned, giving way to  s tumultuous elected presidency. Mr. Yeltsin tried to transform the state economy into a capitalist market by imposing a \u201cshock therapy\u201d of nationwide privatization without price controls. Inflation and economic calamity ensued. By 1997, as Professor Cohen saw it, the Russian economy had become \u201can endless collapse of everything essential for a decent existence.\u201d He became a persistent critic of Mr. Yeltsin, who survived an attempted coup and tried to promote democracy but resigned in 1999 amid growing internal pressures. He was succeeded by his deputy, Mr. Putin. In his book, \u201cFailed Crusade: America and the Tragedy of Post-Communist Russia\u201d (2000), Professor Cohen laid the blame for Russia\u2019s post-Communist economic and social collapse on the United States, for providing bad advice; on academic experts, for what he called \u201cmalpractice throughout the 1990s\u201d; on Western journalists; and on Mr. Yeltsin, for a range of sins: abolishing the Soviet Union, creating a bureaucratic vacuum and generating hyperinflation with his economic shock therapy. \u201cCohen\u2019s thesis is that Yeltsin, rather than Russia\u2019s first democratic leader, was a neo-czarist bumbler who destroyed a democratization process that, in fact, should be credited to Mikhail Gorbachev,\u201d Robert D. Kaplan wrote in  . \u201cCohen is particularly scathing toward American journalists, whom he depicts as overly influenced by the prosperity of a small, rapacious upper class in the major Russian cities, and who seldom ventured out into the countryside to see the terrible price of the reformers\u2019 handiwork.\u201d Stephen Frand Cohen was born in Indianapolis on Nov. 25, 1938, the older of two children of Marvin and Ruth (Frand) Cohen. His father owned a jewelry store and a golf course in Hollywood, Fla. Stephen and his sister, Judith, attended schools in Owensboro, Ky., but Stephen graduated in 1956 from the Pine Crest School, a private school in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He loved the novels of Hemingway. As an undergraduate at Indiana University, he went to England on a study-abroad program. He had saved $300 for a side trip to Pamplona to run with the bulls. But an advertisement he saw for a 30-day, $300 trip to the U.S.S.R. changed his life. Back at Indiana University, he gave up plans to be a golf pro and took up Russian studies. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics and public policy in 1960 and a master\u2019s in Russian studies in 1962. In 1969, he received a doctorate in that subject from Columbia University. Professor Cohen\u2019s marriage in 1962 to the opera singer Lynn Blair ended in divorce. He married Ms. vanden Heuvel in 1988. In addition to her, he is survived by a son, Andrew, and a daughter, Alexandra Cohen, from his first marriage; another daughter, Nicola Cohen, from his second marriage; a sister, Judith Lefkowitz; and four grandchildren. His Columbia dissertation on Mr. Bukharin\u2019s economic ideas grew into his first book, copies of which reached Soviet dissidents, the K.G.B. in Moscow, and eventually Mr. Gorbachev, who put Professor Cohen on his guest list for the 1987 Gorbachev-Reagan summit in Washington. Professor Cohen taught at Princeton from 1968 to 1998, rising to full professor of politics and Russian studies, and at New York University thereafter until his retirement in 2011. His last book, published in 2019, was \u201cWar With Russia? From Putin & Ukraine to Trump & Russiagate.\u201d Many journalistic colleagues accused Professor Cohen of defending Mr. Putin, who curtailed democratic freedoms but boosted the economy, which grew for eight straight years. Wages for ordinary Russians tripled, poverty was reduced, and national growth jumped fivefold as rising prices of Russia\u2019s plentiful oil and gas overcame a depression. In a recent interview for this obituary, Professor Cohen denied that he had \u201cdefended\u201d Mr. Putin. \u201cHe holds views that I also hold,\u201d Professor Cohen said. \u201cIt\u2019s the views that I defend, not Putin. \u201cFrom the moment Yeltsin came on,\u201d he continued, \u201cAmericans thought the Cold War was over. There was disappointment with Putin as a more rational leader. I see him in the Russian tradition of leadership, getting Russia back on its feet. He frightens some of our observers, but I didn\u2019t see it that way.\u201d "},
{"text": "A new book by one of the special counsel\u2019s top deputies, Andrew Weissmann, is the first inside account of the investigation. WASHINGTON \u2014 The team led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, failed to do everything it could to determine what happened in the 2016 election, shying away from steps like subpoenaing President Trump and scrutinizing his finances out of fear he would fire them, one of Mr. Mueller\u2019s top lieutenants argued in the first insider account of the inquiry. \u201cHad we used all available tools to uncover the truth, undeterred by the onslaught of the president\u2019s unique powers to undermine our efforts?\u201d wrote the former prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, in a new book, adding, \u201cI know the hard answer to that simple question: We could have done more.\u201d The team took elaborate steps to protect its files of evidence from the risk that the Justice Department might destroy them if Mr. Trump fired them and worked to keep reporters and the public from learning what they were up to, Mr. Weissmann wrote in \u201cWhere Law Ends: Inside the Mueller Investigation,\u201d which Random House will publish next week. While he speaks reverently of Mr. Mueller, he also says his boss\u2019s diffidence made him ill-suited for aspects of shepherding the politically charged investigation. He saw Mr. Mueller and his deputy, Aaron M. Zebley, as overly cautious. Mr. Weissmann also defended against accusations by the president and his allies that he and other investigators were politically biased \u201cangry Democrats\u201d; Mr. Weissmann said his personal views had no bearing on the crimes that Russian operatives and Trump aides committed. And he elevates particular details \u2014 for example, emphasizing that the   that sent hush payments to an adult film star who alleged an extramarital affair with Mr. Trump had also received \u201cpayments linked to a Russian oligarch.\u201d The president has denied the affair; his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen controlled the account. Mr. Mueller transferred the Cohen matter to prosecutors in New York. Previously a mafia and Enron prosecutor and then a lawyer at the F.B.I. for Mr. Mueller, who was the bureau\u2019s director for 12 years, Mr. Weissmann ran one of three major units for the special counsel\u2019s office. His \u201cTeam M\u201d prosecuted Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort for numerous financial crimes. The goal was to flip him and learn whatever he knew about any Trump campaign links to Russia. Mr. Manafort had worked for pro-Russian interests in Ukraine, and the investigation uncovered ties by his business partner, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, to Russian intelligence. The book builds toward investigators\u2019 discovery that Mr. Manafort had shared internal campaign polling data with Mr. Kilimnik, who flew to the United States to meet with Mr. Manafort during the campaign, asking whether Mr. Trump would permit a peace plan for Russia to essentially take over all of eastern Ukraine. But while admitting this much, Mr. Manafort \u2014 seeing the dangle of a potential pardon from Mr. Trump \u2014 refused to cooperate further. Investigators did not obtain any final puzzle pieces and lacked the evidence to charge anyone in the campaign with a criminal conspiracy involving Russia\u2019s covert electoral assistance. \u201cIt would seem to require significant audacity \u2014 or else, leverage \u2014 for another nation to even put such a request before a presidential candidate,\u201d Mr. Weissmann wrote of Mr. Kilimnik\u2019s request. \u201cThis made what we didn\u2019t know, and still don\u2019t know to this day, monumentally disconcerting: Namely, why would Trump ever agree to this? Why would Trump ever agree to this Russian proposal if the candidate were not getting something from Russia in return?\u201d Mr. Weissmann explained the significance of Mr. Manafort\u2019s interactions with Mr. Kilimnik \u2014 also a major focus of  , which explicitly labeled Mr. Kilimnik a Russian intelligence agent \u2014 more clearly than the Mueller report did. Mr. Mueller had strictly forbidden leaks, and the special counsel team took extraordinary care to protect the high-profile, high-stakes investigation, Mr. Weissmann wrote. They kept window blind slats tilted at an angle to keep out prying eyes, shutting out natural light. They concocted an \u201calmost comically elaborate and surreal\u201d plan to sneak in \u201cthrough the many hidden arteries of the courthouse\u201d to obtain a grand jury indictment without tipping off reporters. And worried about the possibility that Mr. Trump would fire them and the Justice Department would then seal off or destroy their evidence, the Mueller team members packed their numerous applications to judges for search warrants with extensive, up-to-date details about their investigation \u2014 ensuring they backed up their work beyond the reach of the executive branch. Ty Cobb, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, also privately promised to be a \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d and provide a heads up if Mr. Trump was going to fire the special counsel team, according to Mr. Weissmann. In an email, Mr. Cobb wrote that he \u201cnever made the commitment\u201d described by Mr. Weissmann. The investigation played out against the backdrop of regular vilification of the Mueller team by Mr. Trump and his allies like Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity \u2014 who turned out to be in regular contact with Mr. Manafort cooking up a \u201csmear campaign\u201d over text messages. Mr. Weissmann, a major target, wrote that such \u201cad hominem\u201d insinuations of bias appealed to emotion rather than reason. \u201cI am a registered Democrat,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDoes this make Paul Manafort or any of the other 32 people our office charged any less guilty? Did Russia not attack our democracy and disrupt our election with its self-described online information warfare operation? Which facts that we alleged in our various indictments \u2014 and to which many of those we indicted, including Manafort, would plead guilty \u2014 did our attackers believe were invented as a result of our alleged bias as \u2018angry Democrats?\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have recently   to documents showing that cellphones issued to Mr. Mueller\u2019s team were erased during the investigation; Mr. Weissmann twice entered an incorrect passcode too often, triggering a security measure that erased his phone. In an interview, he portrayed the concerns as a \u201ctempest in a teapot\u201d and said his understanding was that all emails and other such data from phones were backed up. He called on the Justice Department to release information about the special counsel\u2019s data backup system. Mr. Weissmann also wrote that he is not \u201canti-Trump\u201d but rather \u201cpro the rule of law.\u201d Still, the distinction is less than clear in a book that also portrays Mr. Trump as a liar and a dangerous demagogue trying \u201cto peel the world around him away from the rule of law \u2014 away from reason itself \u2014 and mold it to accommodate his desire for unchecked power.\u201d Mr. Weissmann was equally scathing about Attorney General William P. Barr, calling him an enabler and likening   as a betrayal and \u201cgut punch.\u201d Mr. Weissmann also criticized colleagues, portraying the special counsel team as divided between aggressive investigators like him, the F.B.I. special agent Omer Meisel and the prosecutor Jeannie Rhee \u2014 who headed \u201cTeam R,\u201d which investigated Russian issues other than those centered on Manafort \u2014 and far more risk-averse law enforcement officials like Mr. Zebley who pulled punches. In one episode in 2017, the Mueller team issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank for information about Mr. Manafort\u2019s income in Ukraine. Deutsche Bank had also lent large sums to the Trump Organization, and the White House somehow found out about the still-secret subpoenas \u2014 though not their focus. The White House demanded to know what investigators were doing, and Mr. Mueller authorized Mr. Zebley to tell the White House that they had not been seeking Mr. Trump\u2019s financial information. \u201cAt that point, any financial investigation of Trump was put on hold,\u201d Mr. Weissmann writes. \u201cThat is, we backed down \u2014 the issue was simply too incendiary; the risk, too severe.\u201d The book provides many other examples of concessions large and small. Investigators did not try to question Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka \u2014 who had spoken in the lobby to a delegation of Russians who came to Trump Tower in June 2016 to meet with campaign leaders who had been promised that they were offering dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. They \u201cfeared that hauling her in for an interview would play badly to the already antagonistic right-wing press \u2014  \u2014 and risk enraging Trump, provoking him to shut down the special counsel\u2019s office once and for all,\u201d he wrote. Similarly, they did not subpoena the Trump Organization for emails about its efforts to develop a Trump-branded building in Moscow, which were active deep into the 2016 campaign. And they did not immunize Mr. Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., a step that would have prevented him from being able to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying about matters like the Trump Tower meeting. Bound by grand-jury secrecy rules, Mr. Weissmann did not come out and say whether Donald Trump Jr. was threatened with or actually issued a subpoena and used his right against self-incrimination to repel it. Mr. Weissmann laid much of the blame for what he saw as a pattern of timidity on Mr. Zebley, portraying him as a primary decision maker. \u201cRepeatedly during our 22 months in operation, we would reach some critical juncture in our investigation only to have Aaron say that we could not take a particular action because it risked aggravating the president beyond some undefined breaking point.\u201d Mr. Weissmann acknowledged, but did not clearly address, concerns that the aging Mr. Mueller had lost a step, both declaring that he was capable of making the tough decisions despite \u201cspeculative concerns\u201d about his health but also describing him in one scene as looking drained and worn down by his years of grueling public service. While Mr. Zebley obtained Mr. Mueller\u2019s sanction for many of his cautious directives, in one striking episode, Mr. Zebley appeared in Mr. Weissmann\u2019s telling to have unilaterally agreed \u2014 without Mr. Mueller\u2019s knowledge \u2014 to a request by the office of the deputy attorney general overseeing them, Rod J. Rosenstein, not to coordinate with state prosecutors \u201cas it would undermine the president\u2019s pardon power.\u201d Two other former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disputed the account. Mr. Rosenstein did not decline any request to share information with state prosecutors, a person familiar with his thinking wrote in an email. Another person familiar with how the special counsel\u2019s office interacted with Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s office denied that there had been any agreement about sharing evidence with or withholding it from state prosecutors, and said Mr. Zebley had consulted with Mr. Mueller on every material decision. On the failure to subpoena Mr. Trump, Mr. Mueller was determined to avoid \u201cany public disagreements\u201d with Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Weissmann wrote. Because the special counsel regulations required telling Congress about any instance in which Mr. Rosenstein overruled him, Mr. Mueller never actually proposed subpoenaing Mr. Trump, instead coyly asking what Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s reaction would be. Mr. Rosenstein just kept demurring. In the end, Mr. Weissmann said in an interview, the caution was more justified early on to avoid provoking Mr. Trump into firing them before they could get going. But he and Ms. Rhee, among others, believed the office should have been willing to be more aggressive later on, after they had learned much of what Russia had done and had already used indictments to drag it into public view. \u201cWe would have subpoenaed the president after he refused our accommodations, even if that risked us being fired,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t sit right. We were left feeling like we had let down the American public, who were counting on us to give it our all.\u201d "},
{"text": "The suspect, a Russian immigrant, was angered by a classroom display of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and sought help identifying the teacher involved. PARIS \u2014 The suspect in the   was an 18-year-old immigrant of Chechen descent who was angered by the classroom display of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, French officials said on Saturday. The suspect, identified by the authorities as Abdoulakh A., stalked the area outside the school on Friday afternoon before following the teacher, whom he stabbed and decapitated with a knife, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ricard, the top antiterrorism prosecutor, said at a news conference. \u201cThe individual was in front of the college in the afternoon and asked students to indicate the future victim to him,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ricard said, referring to the middle school where the teacher, Samuel Paty, had taught. The suspect was fatally shot by the police in a confrontation soon after the killing, which took place in Eragny, a suburb near the school. Investigators found a message planning the attack on the suspect\u2019s cellphone, written a few hours before, Mr. Ricard said. Then, shortly before he was killed by the police, the suspect uploaded a photograph of the victim to Twitter, he added. The gruesome killing appeared to be the culmination of a couple of weeks of tension at the school, Coll\u00e8ge du Bois-d\u2019Aulne, in a quiet, middle-class suburb north of Paris. Muslim parents upset over the classroom display of two caricatures published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo had contacted school and police officials, but videos uploaded on social media by one father widened the dispute to an outside audience. Investigators were still trying to piece together how the suspect spent his days before the attack, Mr. Ricard said. But the suspect did not appear to have any direct ties to the school or to have been previously involved in the dispute. Born in Moscow, the suspect lived in France with the status of a refugee, Mr. Ricard said, adding that he was not known to antiterrorism officials. The brutal killing was the second violent episode within weeks to be linked to the caricatures published by Charlie Hebdo, which had led to deadly attacks in Paris in 2015. Last month, as the trial of accomplices in the 2015 attack got underway, the magazine republished the drawings \u2014 an act that was seen as a bold statement in the name of freedom of expression by some but as reckless and unnecessary provocation by others.  outside the former offices of Charlie Hebdo, apparently angered after watching videos showing protests in Pakistan against the republication of the cartoons. Beyond its brutality, Friday\u2019s killing hit a far bigger nerve in France as President Emmanuel Macron and other top government officials rushed to the scene on Friday evening. Jean-Michel Blanquer, the minister of national education, said that in Friday\u2019s killing, it was \u201cthe republic that was attacked.\u2019\u2019 France said a ceremony would be organized to pay national homage to the slain teacher. The minister\u2019s words reflected the central role played by France\u2019s public schools \u2014 hewing to a national curriculum established by the central government \u2014 in instilling civic values and a national identity. But they also underscored the recurring tensions between France\u2019s traditional republican values and those of newer arrivals, especially those of Muslim faith who oppose the publication of the caricatures. The tensions at Coll\u00e8ge du Bois-d\u2019Aulne emerged early this month as the teacher \u2014 who was 47 and, according to parents and students, had taught at the school for only few years \u2014 broached the topic of freedom of expression. To illustrate the topic, the teacher showed his students \u2014 mostly 13-year-olds \u2014 two caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that had appeared in Charlie Hebdo, Mr. Ricard said. According to an email sent later to the parents by the school principal, the teacher asked students who might be offended by the material to look away or to temporarily leave the classroom. The teacher realized his clumsiness and apologized, according to the email, which was obtained by The New York Times. C\u00e9cile Ribet-Retel, the president of PEEP de Conflans, the local chapter of a national parents\u2019 association, said her group heard from about 20 parents, who expressed their anger or their support for the teacher. Parents met with school officials and both sides appeared to be working toward an understanding, Ms. Ribet-Retel said. \u201cBut then the information got on social media, was amplified and distorted,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Ribet-Retel said. \u201cAnd it became impossible to manage.\u2019\u2019 One particularly vocal parent \u2014 the father of a 13-year-old girl who was upset by the caricatures \u2014 met with the principal and demanded that the teacher be fired, Mr. Ricard said. The father uploaded critical and angry videos on social media on Oct. 7 and Oct. 12, identifying the teacher and the school, he said. Laurent Brosse, the mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, the Paris suburb where the school is, said local officials warned police intelligence that the situation appeared to be spiraling out of control because of the video. \u201cWe did what seemed important to us at that moment,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Brosse said, adding, \u201cWe know that this question about the freedom of expression stirs up tensions in society.\u2019\u2019 But despite these warnings, \u201cthere was no action,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Ribet-Retel said. The video was widely shared on social networks by individuals denouncing anti-Muslim racism and even official accounts of mosques and of Muslim organizations. \u201cIt was blown out of proportion in the Muslim community,\u2019\u2019 said Siham Touazi, a councilor in an adjoining municipality, who received messages linking to the video in several WhatsApp groups. The killing came just weeks after Mr. Macron unveiled a plan to combat what he described as the threat of \u201c \u201d to France\u2019s secularism. Mr. Macron focused in part on education, especially on beating back what he described as threats to the secular values taught in the nation\u2019s schools and citing the example of Muslim parents who were opposed to letting their children take swimming lessons. \u201cThe situation has become so tense in our country over the issues of secularism and Islam that it\u2019s become impossible to have a reasonable conversation,\u2019\u2019 said G\u00e9rard Pommier, the national president of PEEP, the parents\u2019 association. The slain teacher \u2014 described by Ms. Ribet-Retel and many current and former students as a committed and serious instructor \u2014 appeared to try to navigate the tensions in his class on freedom of expression. While he showed two caricatures to his class, he suggested that those who might be offended \u2014 implicitly Muslim students \u2014 leave or look away. In France, where it is illegal to ask people their religion, the teacher\u2019s proposal seemed to violate the country\u2019s secularism, said Rodrigo Arenas, co-president of the F.C.P.E., another parents\u2019 association. Aude Clabaut, a teacher at another school in the area, said that the slain teacher should not have asked students to leave the classroom. But she said that she was frustrated by the growing challenges to secularism in her own classroom, with some students refusing to remove their veils and Muslim parents contesting secularism courses. \u201cI am sad and I am furious,\u201d said Ms. Clabaut, who joined a group of people on Saturday in front of the school where the slain teacher worked. Hundreds of students and parents, as well as residents of the city, gathered to pay tribute to the teacher, at one point singing \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d the national anthem. Some held signs that read \u201cI am a teacher,\u201d in direct reference to the \u201cI am Charlie\u201d support signs that popped up by the thousands hours after the 2015 attack on the magazine. Several students hugged each other, their eyes swollen with tears. But tensions were also present on Saturday afternoon, as some did not hesitate to directly point to Islamism. A man holding a sign \u2014 \u201c Political Islam is a cancer. We eliminate it or we die from it\u201d \u2014 was briefly interrogated by the police and had his sign seized. Norimitsu Onishi reported from Paris, and Constant M\u00e9heut from Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. Antonella Francini contributed research from Paris. "}
