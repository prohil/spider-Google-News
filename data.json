{"text": "The goal is to disrupt Russia\u2019s well-honed information-warfare systems, whether they are poised to hack election systems or influence the minds of voters. Over the past two weeks, United States Cyber Command and a group of companies led by Microsoft have engaged in an aggressive campaign against a suspected Russian network that they feared could hold election systems hostage come November. that hacked the 2016 election for hacking the French elections, cutting power to Ukraine and sabotaging the opening ceremony at the 2018 Olympics. And in Silicon Valley, tech giants including Facebook, Twitter and Google have been sending out statements every few days advertising how many foreign influence operations they have blocked, all while banning forms of disinformation in ways they never imagined even a year ago. It is all intended to send a clear message that whatever Russia is up to in the last weeks before Election Day, it is no hoax. The goal, both federal officials and corporate executives say, is to disrupt Russia\u2019s well-honed information-warfare systems, whether they are poised to hack election systems, amplify America\u2019s political fissures or get inside the minds of voters. But behind the scenes is a careful dance by members of the Trump administration to counter the president\u2019s own disinformation campaign, one that says the outcome on Nov. 3 will be \u201crigged\u201d unless he wins. So while President Trump continues to dismiss the idea of Russian intervention, a combination of administration and industry officials are pushing a different narrative: that U.S. intelligence agencies, Facebook, Twitter, Google and others are avoiding the mistakes of four years ago, when they all had their radars off. But there is also no assurance it will work. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to admit it, but the Russians may not be deterrable,\u201d said James A. Lewis, the director of the technology and public policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cHow far do we have to go? Is this far enough? We are still scoping that out.\u201d No one will be able to assess the effectiveness of the counteroffensive until after Election Day, when Washington circulates the cyberequivalent of battle-damage reports. But even now there are reasons to question whether the efforts to take on Russia, some of which began in the 2018 midterm elections, have been too timid. It is hardly a coincidence that the indictments announced on Monday against hackers with Russia\u2019s G.R.U. were unsealed 15 days before the election. But it is unclear what deterrent effect indictments can have when the G.R.U.\u2019s officers are unlikely to ever see the inside of an American courtroom. One of the hackers named in the indictment was previously charged with hacking U.S. election administrators four years ago. That did not stop him from a brazen hacking on the country of Georgia last year. Likewise, even after Russia was outed for hacking the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, that apparently did nothing to dissuade it from John P. Carlin, the former assistant attorney general for national security who developed much of the Justice Department\u2019s strategy for indicting foreign hackers, and later wrote about it in the book \u201cDawn of the Code War,\u201d said Mr. Trump\u2019s denial of what happened four years ago gave Russia lots of leeway. \u201cThe details in the indictment are stunning and reveal Russian operatives at the direction of the state attacking the whole world,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe conspicuous absence of leadership from President Trump\u201d on the issue was all the more striking given the efforts \u201cto expose and disrupt this activity.\u201d \u201cThese attacks on countries and civilian behavior won\u2019t stop until the commander-in-chief calls it out and works with the rest of the victimized world to deter future indiscriminate attacks,\u201d Mr. Carlin said. If the indictments are the public face of the offensive against the Russians, the effort to dismantle Trickbot \u2014 a vast network of infected computers used by ransomware groups \u2014 is the more covert element. Late last month, the military\u2019s Cyber Command started neutralizing Trickbot with a series of attacks. Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit secured federal court orders to shut down Trickbot\u2019s infrastructure around the world. On Tuesday, Microsoft said the operation had been largely successful. It has taken down over 90 percent of Trickbot\u2019s command-and-control servers. The idea is to keep the Russians on the run, so distracted that they are unable to use those systems for ransomware attacks that could hold the election hostage. \u201cThese guys are really good and really move fast, and we knew they would react to rebuild their systems,\u201d said Tom Burt, the Microsoft executive who is running the team. \u201cWe were prepared to follow them, and tear down whatever they build up.\u201d But as Cyber Command and Microsoft were taking aim at Trickbot, a new hacking threat emerged. Over the past two months, a different group of Russian hackers \u2014 known as \u201cEnergetic Bear\u201d or \u201cDragonfly,\u201d and believed to be operating within the country\u2019s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B. \u2014 has been targeting American state and local networks, according to government and private security researchers. Their goal is still unclear, but the timing \u2014 so close to the election \u2014 and the actor, which was have sent alarm bells ringing at Cyber Command and at security firms like FireEye. CyberScoop of a leaked FireEye report on the campaign on Monday. Officials worry that even if those hackings do not amount to much, the Russians\u2019 very presence inside U.S. state and local systems could be used to support the president\u2019s baseless allegations that the election is \u201crigged.\u201d That was part of the motivation behind an unusual nine-minute video posted online this month \u2014 titled \u201cSafeguarding Your Vote\u201d\u2014 featuring senior American law enforcement, intelligence and cybersecurity officials. \u201cWe are not going to tolerate foreign interference in our elections or criminal activity that threatens the sanctity of your vote or undermines public confidence in the outcome of the election,\u201d Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, assured voters. Mr. Wray and his counterparts have been contradicted at every turn by the president, who continues to assail mail-in voting as an avenue for fraud, for which there is no evidence. Mr. Trump\u2019s claims are often amplified by the Russians, whose main interest is to cast doubt about the credibility of free elections. \u201cTrump has been a godsend to Russia,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. In Silicon Valley, executives believe a \u201cperception hack\u201d may pose the greatest threat to the election and have been mounting their own counternarrative. Facebook, Twitter and Google have all talked up coordination with one another and the government. The companies were credited, with Cisco\u2019s Talos cybersecurity unit, as having played a role in the indictments of the six G.R.U. officers announced on Monday. Twitter has talked up its takedown of state-backed influence campaigns from Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Cuba and Iran, and has slapped more overt warning messages on tweets that violate its policies, including those from the president. Facebook has advertised its takedowns of foreign influence campaigns from China and the Philippines and 300 Russian assets. It has also lowered its tolerance for disinformation. After years of allowing Holocaust deniers a place on its platform, Facebook started censoring that content this month and stepping up its crackdown of QAnon, which promotes a conspiracy that the world is run by Satan-worshiping pedophiles plotting against Mr. Trump. The question is whether these efforts, so late in the election cycle, will have the intended effect, since the president has already primed his supporters, and others, to distrust the \u201cfake news,\u201d the \u201cdeep state\u201d and now, the election.

{"text": "Cathedral of the Armed Forces blends militarism, patriotism and Orthodox Christianity to controversial effect ngels hover above artillery, religious images are adorned with Kalashnikovs and the Virgin Mary strikes a pose reminiscent of a Soviet second world war poster. The imagery inside Russia\u2019s vast Cathedral of the Armed Forces blends militarism, patriotism and Orthodox to breathtaking and highly controversial effect. An hour\u2019s drive from Moscow, the cathedral has a metallic, khaki-green exterior, topped with golden domes and crosses that rise to 95 metres (312ft). Inside is the largest amount of mosaic of any church in the world, with many of the work depicting battles from Russian history and the second world war in particular. During Vladimir Putin\u2019s two decades in charge of , the Soviet victory in the Great Patriotic War, as the second world war is still called here, has gradually become the main building block of a new Russian national identity. Now, the war victory has its own religious shrine, and when future historians look back at the Putin era, they may well decide that this cathedral is its defining building. Soviet war medals are rendered in stained glass on the ceilings, while mosaics show various key battles. Symbolic numbers have been coded into the dimensions \u2013 the diameter of the main dome, for example, is 19.45 metres. Trophy weapons and tanks seized from the Wehrmacht were melted down and used in the creation of the cathedral\u2019s metal floors. \u201cThink of this as you step into the cathedral. As you walk across the floors, you are symbolically delivering a blow to the fascist enemy,\u201d a guide told a tour group of older women in headscarves as they entered the building earlier this month. The cathedral was the brainchild of Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the opening was originally planned for the 75th anniversary of victory over the Nazis, in May. In the end, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the ceremonial opening was delayed until June. Shoigu, Putin, and the Patriarch Kirill of Moscow attended the opening, on 22 June, the anniversary of the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. \u201cOnly a nation that loves God could build such a grand cathedral,\u201d said Bishop Stefan of Klin, who heads the Russian Orthodox church\u2019s department for cooperation with the army and regularly holds services at the cathedral, where he is the patriarch\u2019s designated representative. The 59-year-old bishop, who was an officer in the Soviet and Russian missile defence forces before becoming a priest, defended the use of Soviet symbols, saying the cathedral depicted \u201call the epochs of our state, Holy Rus\u201d and it would be wrong to leave out the second world war, given how many Soviet soldiers were religious. But the imagery has proved controversial. \u201cFor many priests, who were young in the 1970s and 1980s and personally came up against the repressive Soviet machine, which targeted the church, they are in shock and they can\u2019t get over it,\u201d said Sergei Chapnin, a religious scholar in Moscow. \u201cThis is not really an Orthodox cathedral, it\u2019s a cathedral of our new post-Soviet civil religion,\u201d he added. Some minor changes have been made after the original outcry earlier this year, most notably the removal of a mosaic about the Kremlin\u2019s 2014 seizure of Crimea that featured images of Putin and Shoigu. \u201cIt was the wish of our president, who is so modest that he thought it wasn\u2019t right for him to be represented on the mosaic, to remove it,\u201d said Stefan. The mosaic detailing the Crimea events now has no Putin, but does depict the infamous \u201clittle green men\u201d \u2013 Russian special forces, without insignia, who ran the annexation of the peninsula and whose presence in Crimea was initially denied by the Kremlin. In a large mosaic devoted to the Soviet and Russian armies since the second world war, two angels look down at a group of soldiers carrying modern weapons, and there is a list of commemorated conflicts, ending with \u201cforcing peace on Georgia\u201d in 2008, \u201cthe return of Crimea\u201d in 2014 and the \u201cfight against international terrorism\u201d in Syria. There is space for future conflicts to be added. The panel also lists the two Russian wars in Chechnya, as well as Soviet military interventions to crush the Hungarian revolution in 1956 and the Prague spring in 1968, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Asked if the church really wanted to suggest that all these interventions were sacred, Stefan said it was wrong to focus on particular conflicts. \u201cWe are not talking about the geopolitical background at any particular time, we are talking about the fact that our armed forces have sacred help from above, from God and from the heavenly saints. That\u2019s what the cathedral is about.\u201d The cathedral is located at Patriot Park, a \u201cmilitary Disneyland\u201d that was . Three years ago, Shoigu was among 5,000 spectators who watched a , involving tanks, planes and a giant model of the Berlin parliamentary building. With the opening of the cathedral, there are even more options for a family day out. About 20,000 visitors a day have visited on recent weekends, and even on a Tuesday afternoon this week there were hundreds of people inside the cathedral, and many taking excursions. Wrapped around the cathedral\u2019s perimeter, in a mile-long horseshoe, is a bombastic, interactive museum called 1418 Steps to Victory \u2013 one step for each day of the Soviet war effort \u2013 that opened at the same time as the cathedral. Many of the rooms have computer-game-style recreations of episodes from the war playing out on huge screens, and some also have temperature and \u201csmell\u201d elements. Children can pose for photographs with a mannequin of a surrendering Nazi soldier, and there are jigsaw puzzles, souvenir mugs and toy missile launchers for sale in the gift shop. But while there are plenty of war museums in Russia the cathedral is something altogether new, making explicit the quasi-religious subtext of the way the war is remembered in Russia. Dmitry, a 28-year-old altar server working at the cathedral, claimed that the military and religious images on its mosaics, far from being a jarring combination, are in fact a perfect fit: \u201cIn the war, our soldiers martyred themselves so that we could be free and independent. Only Russians are capable of sacrificing themselves to save humanity, just like Jesus did.\u201d "},

{"text": "Despite some tough sanctions and even tougher criticism, Russia has not topped America's foreign policy priorities under President Donald Trump, who has appeared to have a congenial relationship with his counterpart Vladimir Putin. However, that could all change if Democrat nominee Joe Biden wins the November 3 election, according to experts, who are weighing up the implications of a Biden presidency on U.S.-Russia relations. At the very least, analysts expect that a victory for Biden would increase tensions between Washington and Moscow, and would raise the probability of new sanctions on Russia. The country is already operating under international sanctions on some key sectors and Russian officials close to Putin, for actions including its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, interference in the U.S. election in 2016 and reported involvement in a nerve agent attack in the U.K. in 2018. Andrius Tursa, central and eastern Europe advisor at Teneo Intelligence, said a win for Biden would improve transatlantic ties between the U.S. and Europe and would see \"a renewed U.S. commitment to NATO\" that would be welcomed by Europe. However he also said such a result would mean \"mostly downsides for Russia,\" citing a recent history of mutual distrust and acrimonious relations between the Kremlin and U.S. Democrats. \"In general, a potential Biden presidency would be negative for Moscow and likely lead to a further deterioration of bilateral relations, both in terms of rhetoric and substance. The Democratic Party's candidate has long maintained a tough stance towards President Vladimir Putin's administration,\" Tursa said in a note Friday. \"The Kremlin's disdain for Biden, meanwhile, dates back to his vice-presidency, particularly his push for sanctions against Russia in response to the 2014 Ukrainian crisis.\" A meaningful conflict resolution over Crimea, and in the Donbass region in east Ukraine (where there are two pro-Russian regions that declared themselves republics) still eludes Moscow and Kiev, despite efforts by Germany and France to broker a lasting settlement that both sides can live with. Tursa argued that without tangible process in \u2013 a region Biden was heavily involved in as vice president \u2013 \"Moscow could hardly expect any meaningful easing of sanctions,\" and that a potential Biden presidency could lead to more stringent enforcement of existing measures. The risk of new sanctions could also increase, he said, Any new sanctions on Russia are unlikely to be imposed immediately, however, according to Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management. He said on Saturday that \"while I do think the course of U.S.-Russia relations will remain on this deteriorating path I am not sure\u00a0that we should expect an immediate rollout of additional 'pent up' sanctions on Russia.\" \"I think those candidates likely to be running Russian affairs in a Biden presidency are all pretty experienced and level headed. They won't want to roll out sanctions for sanctions sake. They will want to be very proportionate and logical in approach,\" he said, emphasizing that it's \"important for the U.S. to have a business-like relationship with Russia to ensure delivery on the U.S.'s strategic interests.\" He said the two sides, under a Biden presidency, would have to \"learn where they can tolerate each other and get along on certain areas of mutual interest \u2014 such as arms control \u2014 and reducing risks of conflict where strategic interests compete, for example on areas like Ukraine, even Belarus and Turkey. Sanctions will be part of the tool kit herein, but only one such tool.\" is an area that both Russia-watchers believe could be a point of mutual interest and some harmony, however. Biden has signaled as much, saying in 2019 that he would want to see an extension of the major U.S.-Russian nuclear arms reduction treaty, known as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or the implementation something similar. \"Based on recent statements from both sides, negotiations on a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) is one area where progress could be expected if Biden is elected,\" Teneo's Tursa said. \"However, the timeline would be extremely challenging as the current treaty expires on 5 February 2021.\" Russia itself has acknowledged that arms control could be one positive dynamic under a Biden presidency. Earlier in October, Putin criticized what he called \"sharp anti-Russian rhetoric\" from Biden, but also said that he had been encouraged by Biden's comments regarding a new arms treaty or extension of new START.

{"text": "The reach of the GRU spy unit behind attacks on Japan and South Korea is remarkable In the aftermath of Moscow\u2019s hacking of the 2016 US election, many analysts expected the GRU to be punished. After all, Russia\u2019s powerful military spy agency had been caught red-handed. The FBI indicted several GRU hackers in humiliating fashion. The spies who stole Democratic party emails \u2013 tens and thousands of them \u2013 were named and shamed. In fact, the GRU avoided any repressions. In recent years has carried out a sweeping and brutal reorganisation at the top of government, sending a shiver down the spine of nervous bureaucrats. He has sacked or had arrested regional governors and ministers. Even the FSB, Putin\u2019s old spy agency and a rival to the GRU, has seen generals fired. The one organisation that has carried on unscathed is the GRU, at least judging from the latest attacks revealed on Monday by the US and UK. In 2018 the spy agency sought to disrupt the winter Olympics and Paralympics in Pyeongchang in . Its hackers were plotting another cyber-raid for this summer against the Olympics in Japan, now postponed until 2021. None of this is surprising. For years, the Kremlin ran an undercover sports doping programme that achieved extraordinary results \u2013 gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics, finishing top of the medals table at the 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi. And all presided over by Putin himself. A series of Russian whistleblowers revealed this scam. The cheating caused outrage among international sporting bodies. The Kremlin wasn\u2019t contrite. In public, Putin blamed the west and said his country was the victim of an \u201canti-Russian policy\u201d. In private, he unleashed the GRU. The goal was to dig up information that might discredit Russia\u2019s critics. The GRU unit behind the latest attacks on South Korea and , 74455, was involved. It targeted the Rio Olympics, the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), and other bodies. Working out of a glass tower in Khimki, in north-west Moscow, the unit invented a persona to release stolen sports data: the Fancy Bears hack team. They posed as \u201chacktivists\u201d rather than spies. The hackers got hold of medical records and other data from 250 athletes in nearly 30 countries. They included the private health records of Serena Williams, Simone Biles and the cyclists Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome. All had taken therapeutic medication \u2013 permissible under the rules, but spun by the GRU to give the impression of hypocrisy and US-UK doping. The attacks on Japan and South Korea are part of this disruptive pattern. The only difference this time is the level of sophistication. According to the UK, the unit tried to pass itself off as Chinese or North Korean when it targeted the opening ceremony of the 2018 winter games. The tactic is an old one. It is known as \u2013 from the Russian word for disguise. \u201cNo country has weaponised its cyber capabilities as maliciously and irresponsibly as , wantonly causing unprecedented collateral damage to pursue small tactical advantages and to satisfy fits of spite,\u201d the US assistant attorney general, John Demers, said on Monday, announcing the indictment of six GRU officers. Indictment is one thing. But thus far, London and Washington have been unable to stop Russia\u2019s cyber-piracy. The GRU\u2019s reach is remarkable. The US Department of Justice on Monday cited attacks on Ukraine\u2019s critical infrastructure, France\u2019s 2017 presidential election and the Georgian government. There was also a 2018 spear-phishing raid directed at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Hague. It followed the novichok poisoning in Salisbury of Sergei Skripal by two GRU assassins. Clearly Putin is still furious at Moscow\u2019s continuing exclusion from international competitions. The four-year ban was imposed in December 2019, after Moscow sent manipulated athlete data to Wada. Instead of cleaning up Russian sport, Putin seems determined to continue a role he has perfected in recent years: that of global spoiler and disrupter.

{"text": "Moscow sells weapons to both Armenia and Azerbaijan but has also led attempts for the battling sides to put down their arms. Two centuries ago, Russian czars proudly proclaimed that they \u201cliberated\u201d Armenians from the rule of Ottoman Turkey and Iran. Right after World War II, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin planned to invade and annex eastern Turkey to \u201cexpand\u201d Soviet Armenia and get access to the Mediterranean. Post-Communist Russia seems to be following the same pattern of \u201cprotecting\u201d Armenians from their neighbours \u2013 Turkic-speaking ex-Soviet Azerbaijan and its closest ally, Turkey. And when the festering, decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous breakaway region of Azerbaijan dominated by ethnic Armenians since the early 1990s, reopened in late September, it was Russia that stepped in as a peacemaker. Armenian leaders still think that their best hopes lie with Moscow. \u201cIn recent days, Russia could play its role of Armenia\u2019s strategic ally \u2026 at the highest level,\u201d Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said in televised remarks on October 14. \u201cI am sure it will keep playing this role unambiguously and undoubtedly, in the best traditions of friendship of the Armenian and Russian people.\u201d Armenian observers say that their nation \u2013 along with ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh \u2013 maintains the pro-Moscow geostrategic balance in the Southern Caucasus region that straddles Eastern Europe and Middle East. To them, the biggest flareup of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict that has killed hundreds of soldiers and dozens of civilians is a mere resumption of Ankara\u2019s \u201cimperialistic\u201d policies \u2013 and anti-Armenian sentiments that led to the mass killings of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey a century ago. Armenia and many Western nations call the killing of up to 1.5 million Armenians a \u201cgenocide\u201d, while Turkey refutes such accusations. \u201cIt is the resistance of Armenians that helps maintain the geopolitical balance\u201d in the region, Boris Navasardian, an analyst based in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, told Al Jazeera. \u201cOtherwise, the world would face yet another precedent, a fait accompli \u2013 extermination of some Armenians and expulsion of other Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh and the establishment of Turkey\u2019s dominance over most of the Southern Caucasus,\u201d he said. But the days of Russian czars obsessed with the \u201creturn\u201d of Constantinople to Orthodox Christians and upending Ottoman Turkey\u2019s dominance over the Middle East and the Balkans are long gone. These days, the confrontation between Turkey and Russia has no such overtones. Russia has clashed with Turkey regarding Syria and Libya, but another direct confrontation seems out of sight. And Moscow\u2019s pro-Armenian tilt has not result in severed ties with Baku. Azerbaijani President Ilkham Aliyev studied diplomacy at a prestigious Russian university, and his father and predecessor Heydar Aliyev spent decades working in Moscow as a top KGB officer. But many Azerbaijanis see Moscow\u2019s preference as the main obstacle in settling the oldest conflict in the former Soviet Union. \u201cIt was Russia that helped occupy Nagorno-Karabakh and districts around it, and has all these years stood in Baku\u2019s way to settle the conflict peacefully,\u201d Baku-based analyst Emil Mustafayev told Al Jazeera. While Ankara pledged to back Azerbaijan, Turkey\u2019s linguistic and cultural sibling, \u201cuntil the end of the occupation,\u201d Russia seems to be limited to a secondary role, some observers say. Armenia and Russia are part of a security treaty of six ex-Soviet nations, which does not include Azerbaijan, that must help each other militarily in case of armed conflicts. Moscow also has a military base in Armenia, but the Kremlin has not dispatched a single soldier to support the Armenians. After the hostilities began, Russia only navy drills in the Caspian, north of Baku \u2013 and hastily said that they \u201cdon\u2019t pose any threat and don\u2019t impose restrictions on the economic activities of the Caspian littoral states\u201d. Russia\u2019s peacemaking efforts have also failed. Two Moscow-brokered ceasefires inked on October 10 and October 18 were broken within hours, but Russian diplomats rule out a military solution to the conflict. \u201cWe stand by our viewpoint \u2013 a peaceful settlement is not only possible, it remains the only way,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on October 14. Some see this political inertia as a sign of weakness. \u201cMoscow is almost not reckoned with, it appears like a declining power and doesn\u2019t show any principles, and it is the principles that play a big role in international relations,\u201d Pavel Luzin, a Russia-based defence analyst with the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington think-tank, told Al Jazeera. The lack of principles is especially apparent when it comes to arms sales. Moscow has for years been shipping weaponry to both Baku and Yerevan. In a buying spree fuelled by petrodollars, oil-rich Azerbaijan some $24bn on arms between 2008 and 2018, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a think-tank that monitors military spendings worldwide.\u00a0 Baku bought tanks, APCs, artillery systems, multiple rocket launchers and drones made in Russia, Belarus, Turkey and Israel. Yerevan was vexed by Russia\u2019s eagerness to supply arms. \u201cThis is a very painful issue for us. Our nation is very concerned about the fact that our strategic partner is selling weapons to Azerbaijan,\u201d Armenia\u2019s President Serzh Sargsyan said in 2014. His resource-poor and cash-strapped nation mostly got cheaper and older Russian weaponry \u2013 free of charge or on credit, spending a mere $4bn in 2008-2018, but spending up to a fifth of its annual state budget, the SIPRI said. Another explanation of Russia\u2019s indecisiveness is the peaceful 2018 uprising that toppled pro-Russian and allegedly corrupt President Sargsyan and installed former publicist Pashinyan at the helm. He tried to diversify Armenia\u2019s political alliances and sought closer ties with the West. \u201cArmenia is, in essence, paying for its neoliberal discourse personified by Pashinyan,\u201d Aleksey Kushch, a political analyst based in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. He says that the Kremlin throws its political weight behind separatist regions in the former Soviet Union \u2013 in Ukraine\u2019s Donbass, Moldova\u2019s Transnistria and Georgia\u2019s South Ossetia and Abkhazia \u2013 as long as their instigators do not veer off a pro-Russian course. \u201cRussia\u2019s \u2018coercion to friendship\u2019 will take place anywhere [in the former Soviet Union] where street revolutions won,\u201d he said using the term \u201ccoercion to peace\u201d coined in the Kremlin during the 2008 Russian-Georgian war. The current conflict may have long-term consequences for Moscow\u2019s clout in the South Caucasus. \u201cJudging by the statements of [President] Aliyev that a new era will begin in the region after the war, Baku has finally made serious conclusions about Russia\u2019s role, and its ties with Moscow won\u2019t be the same,\u201d analyst Mustafayev said. The main city in the disputed mountain region resembles a ghost town, where people share stories of grief underground. Khadija Shahnazarli\u2019s mother, father and infant sister were buried together. Rivals use official social media accounts to ramp up rhetoric and deny claims of attacks, but can either be believed?

{"text": "If you enjoyed reading this, subscribe for more! We have been through a time of casting away stones. Now is a time to gather stones together.\u201d \u2014Senior Russian Federation Official, Chechnya, 1995 Since shortly after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, Russia\u2019s aims and policies in the South Caucasus have been constant, but its capabilities to project power and influence have fluctuated. Russia\u2019s engagement with the entire Caucasus region is best characterized as a tide. Its power and influence began to ebb at the start of the Karabakh conflict\u2014with the February 1988 massacre of Armenians in the Azerbaijani city of Sumqayit being the key galvanizing event. After that, the tide receded rapidly, leaving even Russian possessions in the North Caucasus without effective central control. The First Chechen War marked low tide, which only began to rise with the Second Chechen War, beginning in 1999. Until about 2004, Russia was too weak and internally divided to project power and influence in the wider Caucasus region in a meaningful way. To be sure, Russian influence was never gone completely, even during the lowest ebb of the tide. Russia still marshaled greater resources than the new states of the Caucasus could muster, and it threw its weight around. But in the 1990s, Russia did not have a unified governing apparatus, but rather a mass of competing clans among which regional actors could maneuver. For example, after the Soviet collapse, Moscow left the Russian military units in the Caucasus to their own devices. Those units served as mercenaries, arms suppliers, and logistics providers to both sides in the Karabakh conflict. It took a decade for Moscow to reassert its so-called power vertical in the Caucasus, symbolized by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s success in 2004 in finally ousting chief of the general staff Anatoliy Kvashnin. Russia\u2019s assertiveness in the region grew steadily thereafter, with sharp upticks after the 2008 war with Georgia and Putin\u2019s return to the presidency in 2012. But while Moscow has gained the capacity to project more power and influence, the regional landscape has changed. The surge in fighting over Nagornyy Karabakh that began in late September 2020 has demonstrated that Russia is struggling to contend with a vastly more complicated landscape. More external actors are on the scene, most notably Turkey, and all three South Caucasus states\u2014Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia\u2014have adapted their strategies to deal with the new environment. Russia\u2019s increased efforts have had decidedly mixed results. Three factors were evident when the Soviet Union collapsed and continue today, narrowing Russian policy options in the region. Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia are all radically different, with varying attitudes toward Russia and Moscow\u2019s rule throughout the Imperial and Soviet eras. For centuries, Armenia has sought Russia\u2019s protection against Turkey and Iran, which ruled most of the Armenian historic homelands. This security concern was paramount in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet collapse: the Soviet army had disappeared, leaving the Turkish Third Army as the most potent military force in the wider region. For its part, post-Soviet Russia views Armenia as its closest friend in the region. A large and influential Armenian diaspora in Russia has maintained those positive feelings. Azerbaijani elites, russified by the oil boom of the late nineteenth century, have largely been friendly to Russia. Thanks to former president Heydar Aliyev\u2014who rose through the ranks of the Soviet KGB and neither feared nor hated the post-Soviet rulers of Russia\u2014a generally positive attitude toward Russia survived the nationalisms of the years immediately following the Soviet collapse. Though post-Soviet Russia was initially suspicious of the expansion of Turkish and Western influence in Azerbaijan, Russia has since forged close energy relations with Turkey. In the early period, these commercial relations took precedence in the Russia-Turkey relationship. More recently, as detailed later in the paper, the increasing ambiguity of Russian-Turkish relations has complicated Russia\u2019s relations with Azerbaijan. Armenia and Azerbaijan have incorporated friendly relations with Russia into a wider strategy: former Armenian foreign minister Vartan Oskanian described it as a multivectoral approach, in which \u201cforeign policy vectors point in different directions.\u201d It entails seeking close relations with and assistance from powers other than Russia, primarily the United States and the European Union (EU). Large Armenian diasporas in the United States and France have aided this endeavor. In contrast, a poor record on democracy and human rights, as well as the Armenian diaspora\u2019s efforts in the United States, have hobbled Azerbaijan. In the United States, congressional legislation blocked most assistance to Azerbaijan until waiver authority was granted in 2001 in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks and Azerbaijan\u2019s subsequent role in assisting U.S. antiterrorism efforts elsewhere. In Georgia, nationalism remains centered on the rejection of Russia. Since the massacre of unarmed civilians by Soviet troops in the capital, Tbilisi, in 1989 and the post-independence presidency of former Soviet dissident\u2014and extreme nationalist\u2014Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Georgian society has generally come to view Russia as a usurping occupier. February 25\u2014the day the Red Army invaded Tbilisi in 1921\u2014is still observed annually as Soviet Occupation Day. Georgians explain away decades of fawning over the \u201coccupiers\u201d as one ambassador did: \u201cFor all those years that the Russians ruled us, we told them we loved them. And they actually believed us.\u201d Georgian warlords deposed Gamsakhurdia in January 1992 and installed former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze as a weak figurehead. His tenure as president involved a constant renegotiation of his powers to gain ascendancy over those warlords. In the early 1990s, still at his weakest vis-\u00e0-vis the warlords and pressured by Russian support for Abkhaz and Ossetian separatism, he tried to harness, not reverse, the extreme nationalism of his predecessor\u2019s supporters, especially those displaced from Abkhazia by Russian-backed separatists. For their part, Russians have acted as emotionally as the Georgians, seeing Georgia\u2019s aspirations toward the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU as the betrayal of its once advantageous position within Moscow\u2019s empire. During one regularly occurring period of heightened tensions, a normally calm senior Russian diplomat asked, \u201cWhen the Soviet Union was ruled by people named Jughashvili, Orjonikidze, and Beria, just who was occupying whom?\u201d After the September 11, 2001, attacks, as U.S. troops were arriving in Georgia to train Georgians in counterterrorism, an embittered Russian general, recalling the old times of Russian officers\u2019 warm reception in Georgia over countless song-and-wine-filled banquets, said, \u201cThe Americans think they will teach the Georgians to fight. In reality, the Georgians will teach the Americans to sing.\u201d Russia cannot deal with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia in isolation because the countries\u2019 own relations with one another are dense and fraught with tension and conflict. Most salient is the Karabakh conflict, over which Armenians and Azerbaijanis have shed so much blood since 1987. Both sides appeal to Russia for support and view Russian amity toward the other side as a betrayal. In the early years, Russia tried to profit from the conflict, clandestinely providing weaponry and mercenaries to both sides. In 1992 and 1993, Russians backed two coups to install puppets in Azerbaijan, but both backfired. In 1992, former Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov\u2019s attempt to return from Moscow was thwarted by the nationalist Azerbaijan Popular Front. And in 1993, Surat Huseynov\u2019s revolt against the Popular Front was hijacked by Aliyev, who took power for himself alone. Thereafter, Russia stepped back in the region. Since brokering a ceasefire in the Karabakh conflict in 1994, Moscow has limited its interventions to trying (unsuccessfully) to get the sides to agree to a Russia-led peacekeeping force of the sort Moscow installed to control the Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transdniestria separatist conflicts. Russia remains a supplier of weaponry to both sides, and every major arms sale to one provokes protests from the other. Because Azerbaijan\u2019s oil revenues expanded, it has been able to diversify its defense procurements, but Armenia remains dependent on Russia for arms and security guarantees. Georgia is closely intertwined with both Armenia and Azerbaijan. There are large Armenian and Azerbaijani minorities in Georgia (in separatist Abkhazia, Armenians actually outnumber the Abkhaz). Despite initial nationalist difficulties in Borchaly, an Azerbaijani-inhabited section of Georgia, Georgian-Azerbaijani relations have been good almost since Georgia\u2019s independence\u2014largely thanks to a reconciliation of convenience between two Soviet-era rivals, Eduard Shevardnadze and Heydar Aliyev. Aliyev needed Georgia to enable the western transit of Azerbaijan\u2019s hydrocarbon exports and the import of western goods from Turkey. Shevardnadze needed Azerbaijan to secure oil and gas pipelines to provide both transit royalties and strategic importance to the West. He also needed Aliyev to help ensure that the large Azerbaijani population of Georgia reliably voted for Shevardnadze\u2019s political grouping, the Citizens Union. Georgian-Armenian relations have been trickier. A portion of the Armenian population in Georgia is concentrated in Javakheti, near a large Soviet (later Russian) military base that fueled the region\u2019s economy until it was closed in 2007. From 1992 to 1993, the Javakhk Armenians sought independence, apparently with Russian encouragement. But Armenia\u2019s only transit routes to Russia and the West lay through Georgia, as the Karabakh conflict had closed Armenia\u2019s borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan, so the government of then Armenian president Levon Ter-Petrosyan tamped down Javakhk separatism. Relations between the two countries grew closer after Mikheil Saakashvili came to the presidency in Georgia in 2004, and they have remained friendly under subsequent leaders. To this day, Russian policy in the South Caucasus is intertwined with the North Caucasus\u2014to which Russia has devoted the blood and treasure of generations and which post-Soviet Russia sees as key to the integrity of the Russian state. Russia\u2019s domestic security concerns have intruded on the South Caucasus in a number of areas. As Russian power ebbed away at the end of the Soviet era, the Russian army\u2014for the first time in centuries\u2014no longer wielded the decisive force in the region. The Turkish Third Army was the most powerful military in the region, and locals adapted to the strategic effects. Russia threw its diminished resources into the Caucasus to suppress the first Chechen rebellion\u2014and met defeat. Russia\u2019s subsequent remilitarization of the region, and its demands to adapt the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty to allow for greater freedom of movement in the Flank, stemmed from its perceived need to redress the military imbalance and reassert power and influence in the region. To address Russia\u2019s moves to adapt the treaty, Azerbaijan and Georgia allied with Moldova and Ukraine to form what later solidified into the Organization for Democracy and Economic Development (known simply as the GUAM). Ossetians, ethno-linguistically and religiously different from their neighbors, have been Russia\u2019s principal allies in the North Caucasus for two centuries. As Russia dealt with a host of ethnic nationalisms in the first years after the Soviet collapse, including Chechen separatism and later an armed Islamist movement, North Ossetia gained strategic importance to, and leverage with, Russian leadership. It has used that leverage to ensure robust Russian support for South Ossetian separatism from Georgia. Likewise, other ethnic groups in the mountains of the North Caucasus (for example, the Chechens, Kabardians, and Cherkes) saw in Abkhaz separatism from Georgia the validation of their own ethnic nationalisms. With Russian facilitation, many so-called volunteers made their way to Abkhazia to join the separatist war against Georgia from 1992 to 1993. Among the most effective of these was the Chechen Shamil Basayev, who was later an archnemesis of the Russians but their ally in that struggle. During the Second Chechen War, fighters and their families took refuge in Georgia\u2019s Pankisi Gorge, which was effectively outside the Georgian government\u2019s control. Russian president Boris Yeltsin called Shevardnadze in November 1999 to demand the reinstatement of Russian border troops in Georgia and passage for Russian military units through Georgia to attack Pankisi from the south. Shevardnadze stalled and then called on the Americans to dissuade Yeltsin. Later, after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States sent troops to train the Georgians to restore security in Pankisi, forestalling Russian actions there. Even worse, from the Russian point of view, Shevardnadze made a deal with Ruslan Gelayev, a Chechen commander sheltering in the Pankisi Gorge, to launch an attack on Abkhaz-held territory in 2001. The attack failed, but the Russian authorities viewed this series of events as proof that Georgia was treacherous and untrustworthy. Lastly, Azerbaijan shares a long border and considerable ethnic overlap with Russia\u2019s Dagestan Autonomous Republic, where Salafist proselytizing made extensive inroads in the 1990s. After some years, a full-fledged Islamist guerrilla movement formed and linked up with the remains of the armed Chechen nationalist movement, which also fell under Salafist influence. When attacks began on authorities in Dagestan, security cooperation with Azerbaijan gained importance for Russian internal security. The stage was thus set early on for a consistent\u2014even static\u2014Russian policy toward the South Caucasus: an economy-of-force balancing act to preserve Russia\u2019s traditional friendship and strategic alliance with Armenia without harming Russia\u2019s economic and security relationship with Azerbaijan; and a constant, emotional, and ever-deepening hostility toward Georgia. Russia views the international arena as a series of camps, each centered by a power whose greatness is confirmed by possessing a camp. Russia has been keen to ensure that the new nations forged out of former Soviet republics remain in its camp and has formed multinational institutions to cement those relations. Initially, Russia had hopes that the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), formed when the Soviet Union broke up, might fill the bill. Azerbaijan and Armenia joined the CIS at its inception in 1991. But it was not until 1993 that Georgia\u2019s president Shevardnadze\u2014under Russian military pressure in support of Abkhaz separatism and facing a rebellion by ousted former president Gamsakhurdia\u2014reluctantly acceded. In 2008, Georgia withdrew from the CIS after the country\u2019s defeat in the Russo-Georgian War. With the CIS having little influence, Russia put forward two other institutions to accomplish the task. The Collective Security Treaty, originally signed in 1992, became the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in 2002, designed as a counterweight to NATO. Armenia joined to relieve its security concerns with regard to Turkey; Azerbaijan and Georgia did not. The Eurasian Customs Union, officially formed in 2000 but active from 2010 onward, also included Armenia but not Azerbaijan or Georgia. In 2014, Russia turned the Customs Union into the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), intended as a mirror image of the EU. Moscow\u2019s ongoing attempts to equate the two organizations on the international stage has had significant effects on the Caucasus, as noted later in this paper. Azerbaijan was able to avoid joining Russia\u2019s so-called camp thanks to its independent oil revenues, which have grown for both Azerbaijan and other post-Soviet Caspian littoral states. In the early 1990s, Moscow\u2019s ability to project power was low and Russia could only protest ineffectually when littoral countries signed hydrocarbon extraction contracts in the absence of an international agreement to define national rights in the Caspian. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan brought in Western energy majors without fearing Russia\u2019s reaction (Azerbaijan signed its first major contract in 1993). The status of the Caspian was not codified even preliminarily until 2018, and to this day, no treaty covers exploitation of the seabed. Russia could not fight \u2019em, so it joined \u2019em, settling for sharing in the profits from hydrocarbon development and transit. For a time in the mid-1990s, the United States and Russia maneuvered against one another through their respective support of pipelines. The United States heavily promoted the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline as an alternative to a Russian monopoly on hydrocarbon transit to the West. However, U.S. doctrine demanded that the pipeline be commercially viable in its own right, and the United States refused to put resources into boosting that viability. Recognizing this, Russia banked on the oil majors\u2019 desire to save money by transporting the oil by tanker across the Black Sea and through the Turkish Straits. But when then BP chair John Browne visited Istanbul and inspected the narrow Bosphorus passage, he decided the route was too risky and threw the weight of the oil majors behind BTC. Russia\u2019s closest relationship in the South Caucasus remains with Armenia, the country most firmly entrenched in Russia\u2019s camp. It is frequently called a strategic alliance, and for Armenia this is certainly the case as 3,000 Russian troops based in its second-largest city, Gyumri, form a trip wire against Turkish military action. While Azerbaijan generally deals with other countries transactionally, another criterion takes precedence: their stance on Armenia and the Karabakh conflict. This is the trickiest situation for Russia to manage: Azerbaijan is Russia\u2019s largest trading partner in the Caucasus, the two countries have important common issues regarding hydrocarbons, and Russia sees a strategic aim in keeping Azerbaijan out of what it calls the Western camp. Therefore, while supporting Armenia, Russia has tried to avoid alienating Azerbaijan, including during the recent surge in fighting. Until 2010, Russia was discreet about its arms sales to Armenia to avoid provoking Azerbaijan, denying reports of large arms transfers when they surfaced in 2009. More recently, Russia has started transferring increasingly sophisticated weaponry to both sides and has been more open about its balancing. For example, in 2010, Russia signed a new lease on its military base in Gyumri (extending it to 2044) and agreed to sell S-300 surface-to-air missiles to Azerbaijan. As part of this balancing, Russia is involved in attempts to mediate between Azerbaijan and Armenia to resolve the Karabakh conflict. Since 1995, Russia has been a co-chair of the Minsk Group, a body under the aegis of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and composed of a number of countries interested in brokering peace. In 1997, the United States and France joined Russia as co-chairs, and the three countries have conducted all negotiations thereafter without significant input from the other group members. This structure has facilitated Russia-West cooperation to keep a politically insoluble problem from flaring into war and metastasizing beyond the actual frontline states. When Dmitry Medvedev was president of Russia (2008\u20132012), he poured great efforts into Russian peace initiatives, and with French and U.S. assent Russia came to dominate the process. As part of this campaign, Medvedev also supported the 2008 opening between Armenia and Turkey, Azerbaijan\u2019s closest ally. That rapprochement failed, however, due to opposition from key constituencies on both sides. Ultimately, Azerbaijan and Armenia were not interested in a negotiated solution, and Medvedev\u2019s initiative foundered. Russia\u2019s relations with Georgia quickly went into a downward spiral after the Soviet collapse. Russia used substantial military force to ensure the survival and then victory of the separatist rebellion in Abkhazia and leveraged that and a revolt by Gamsakhurdia to force Shevardnadze to accept a Russian peacekeeping force in western Georgia. Still hostile, Russia backed two attempts, in 1995 and 1998, to assassinate Shevardnadze. Until the latter attempt, Shevardnadze had been trying to play Russia and the United States off against each other, but these actions drove Shevardnadze squarely into the arms of the United States. The Russians loathed Shevardnadze for his role in the collapse of the Soviet bloc\u2014on one television program, he was reviled as \u201cthe Ostap Bender of the Soviet Union,\u201d after the con-man protagonist of the classic Soviet comic novel . But that feeling paled beside the emotions stoked in the Russian leadership by the flamboyant and mercurial Mikheil Saakashvili, who ousted Shevardnadze at the end of 2003 and became president in 2004. In that year, Saakashvili also ousted the quasi-independent Aslan Abashidze from his rule over the autonomous Batumi region, which housed a Russian military base. Also in 2004, tensions flared in South Ossetia. Russia retaliated over the next few years, banning the import of Georgian products, banning flights between Russia and Georgia, closing the land border between the two countries, and launching an aggressive campaign against ethnic Georgians in Russia, including Russian citizens, their businesses, and their families. In 2007, Russia closed off most of North Ossetia to foreigners, allowing preparations for war to proceed unseen by the outside world. And in 2008, as tensions flared again in South Ossetia, Russian troops invaded, defeating Georgia\u2019s forces in short order, occupying parts of Georgia outside Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and incorporating these conquests into the separatist statelets, which Russia shortly thererafter recognized as independent. But the war also brought the expansion of a new competitor\u2019s presence: the small, neutral OSCE mission was scrapped, and a large new EU Monitoring Mission was put in its place. Despite the limitations placed on that mission, the overall EU presence and commitment sharply increased. Putin\u2019s return to the presidency in 2012 came with a more assertive foreign policy. New leaders wholly dependent on Russia were installed in the separatist entities Russia supported, including South Ossetia and Abkhazia, replacing long-established leaders who were pro-Russian but possessed their own independent power bases. More importantly, Russia began to treat the European Union\u2014not just NATO\u2014as a strategic rival intent on taking over parts of what Medvedev had called Russia\u2019s sphere of \u201c .\u201d Five years earlier, that view had been restricted to the , or senior officers of the hard power ministries (primarily the military, internal affairs, and security services); after Putin\u2019s return to the presidency, it became Russia\u2019s official policy. The Ukrainian crisis of 2013\u20132014 began with Putin pressuring both Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych and Armenian president Serzh Sargsyan into repudiating the EU Association Agreements they had signed and instead joining the nascent Russia-centric EAEU. The pressure on Sargsyan included a Putin visit to Azerbaijan\u2019s capital, Baku, to discuss arms sales. Yanukovych\u2019s caving to Putin\u2019s pressure triggered the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine and his eventual downfall. Sargsyan did not immediately face the same consequences. He explained to the nation that security concerns necessitated joining the Russian-led organization\u2014that only Russia could safeguard Armenia from its neighbors. However, after rejecting the EU, Sargsyan immediately tried to placate it. Negotiations eventually restarted on a trade agreement, and in 2017, Armenia signed a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the EU. After a few protests, Armenians fell in line with Sargsyan\u2019s capitulation to Putin\u2019s wishes: they assumed their security expectations would be met and that this change was worth the economic disadvantages of giving up the association with the EU. Indeed, when a few months later Russia occupied Crimea and annexed it after the fig leaf of a controlled referendum, Armenians saw this as a model and justification for future annexation of Nagornyy Karabakh and the surrounding territories. Russia\u2019s actions had called into question all territorial dispositions after the Soviet collapse, which had been agreed among the union republics, codified in the CIS Treaty, and endorsed by the international community. With borders now questioned and Russia more capable of projecting power, it was better to be a close ally of Russia than a potential victim. But in April 2016, Armenians suffered a rude awakening. On April 1, Azerbaijan began a military operation along the line of contact in Karabakh and, over the next four days, managed to regain a few strategic points occupied by the Karabakh Armenians years before. Russia\u2019s reaction was to maintain its balancing act. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went to the region explicitly to be a neutral mediator. He brought a ceasefire plan and proposed the Russian peacekeeping force that had been rejected so many years earlier. That approach did not go over well with the Armenian populace. In their view, Armenia was a treaty ally of Russia and had given up European aspirations to stay in Russia\u2019s camp\u2014and, therefore, Russia should be on Armenia\u2019s side. However, as far as Russia was concerned, legally, the combat had nothing to do with Armenia but was between Nagornyy Karabakh and Azerbaijan. The Armenian people did not see it that way, after being convinced by their leaders over a generation that Karabakh and Armenia had become a single polity. Sargsyan, who initially supported the idea of a Russian peacekeeping force, was seen as having sold out Armenian interests. He then had to backtrack, putting fatal cracks in his prestige and authority. Almost immediately, mutinies and demonstrations broke out, occasionally with a subtle anti-Russian flavor. In July 2016, a group of gunmen calling themselves Sasna Tsrer (\u201cDaredevils of Sassoun,\u201d from an Armenian epic poem) violently took over a police station and held out against government forces for two weeks, demanding Sargsyan\u2019s resignation. Even after they surrendered, they retained widespread support, which translated into a people fed up with the ruling elite and with Russia. Other factors\u2014such as a notorious murder by a Russian soldier, price hikes by the Russian-owned electricity supplier, and continued arms sales to Azerbaijan\u2014further exacerbated popular discontent. In 2017, faced with term limits when his presidency was to expire in 2018, Sargsyan chose one of the standard post-Soviet autocratic solutions to staying in power: establishing a parliamentary system, turning the presidency into a figurehead, and becoming prime minister. Sargsyan and his Dashnak nationalist allies duly won parliamentary elections in 2017, and a figurehead president was in due course elected in 2018. Then the play went off script: the aggrieved populace rose up in demonstrations, and in just over a month, Sargsyan was ousted. Opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan was installed as acting prime minister, and new elections affirmed his position later in the year. So far, this scenario resembles one of the \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d that Putin had railed against for the previous fifteen years and had tried to reverse through military force in Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine. But instead of condemning Pashinyan (who had sharply criticized Russia during the demonstrations) and lending full support to Sargsyan (one of Putin\u2019s most loyal supporters), Putin was remarkably restrained throughout and had a friendly and supportive meeting with Pashinyan just days after the latter took power, publicly offering him his congratulations and best wishes. It is possible that Russia blamed Sargsyan for the anti-Russian sentiment following the clashes of April 2016. But it is also clear that Pashinyan made efforts to reassure Putin, as he\u2014like the entire Armenian electorate\u2014understood that Russia remained the guarantor of Armenia\u2019s security vis-\u00e0-vis its much larger neighbors. He also understood that any rift with Russia would create a vulnerability that Azerbaijan could exploit with regard to Karabakh; Pashinyan knew he could not afford any daylight between Armenia and Russia. He left Armenia in the EAEU and CSTO. He made clear that he would pursue a democratic system, but he \u201calso said that he viewed democracy as a firm belief, rather than a geopolitical orientation, making clear the distinction.\u201d Perhaps the fact that Putin knew this as well, implying no major changes in Armenia\u2019s strategic orientation, occasioned his restraint: if there is no threat that Armenia will leave its camp, Russia can continue balancing its policy toward Azerbaijan and Armenia. Azerbaijan is the type of country with which Putin seems to feel comfortable\u2014a stable autocracy whose cautious ruler pursues consistent and predictable policies. Azerbaijan causes few headaches for Russia and demands only that its transactional approach be reciprocated. President Ilham Aliyev began his rule only three years after Putin took over Russia; his father Heydar Aliyev had ruled Azerbaijan for a decade before that, not counting the Soviet period, when he also ruled the country as his own fiefdom. Heydar Aliyev\u2019s time in the senior-most ranks of the Soviet state, Communist Party, and security services made his attitude very different from other post-Soviet rulers, some of whom had been minor provincial apparatchiki in Soviet times and saw Moscow as the source of all power. Heydar Aliyev treated Russia\u2019s post-Soviet rulers without the fealty or fear that some of his contemporaries showed. Ilham Aliyev does not have the experience or ability of his father, but he has inherited that legacy of autonomous sovereignty. If Pashinyan intends to show that democracy is a belief, not a geopolitical choice, the Aliyevs have long since shown that the same is true of autocracy. Azerbaijan and Russia have enjoyed a functional, transactional relationship that is cordial, neighborly, and devoid of emotion. To some extent, Azerbaijan grew ideologically closer to Russia in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, as both countries saw themselves as attacked and undermined by a fifth column of Western-supported civil society and nongovernmental organizations. In 2014, the chief of Azerbaijan\u2019s presidential apparatus\u2014usually considered closest to Russia in the Azerbaijani leadership\u2014published a long, scathing article outlining that worldview. He even implied that charges of human rights violations against a country only proved that its leadership was defending its sovereignty. But ideological sympathy never overcame Azerbaijan\u2019s transactional approach to relations with Russia. In 2012, Azerbaijan demanded a sharp increase in the rent Russia was paying for the Soviet-era Qabala radar station. The station was part of the Soviet and Russian strategic early warning system, and therefore the United States favored its continued functioning to help reduce uncertainty about potential missile launches. Nonetheless, Azerbaijan stuck to its price demands, and the Russians eventually closed the station at the end of 2012. Apart from its transactional approach, the Azerbaijani leadership has a single prism for judging the actions of all other countries: the Karabakh conflict. Since independence, Azerbaijan has rejected virtually all forms of multilateral cooperation involving Armenia. That has imposed a durable limit on the extent of rapprochement with Russia. For example, Azerbaijan has not joined the CSTO, of which Armenia is a member; to do so, it would have to renounce any military solution to the Karabakh conflict, and it has been a tenet of faith in Azerbaijan that only the credible threat of a military solution can pressure Armenia to negotiate seriously. Nor has Azerbaijan joined the EAEU, as Armenia did. Joining it could limit Azerbaijan\u2019s ability to use its economic leverage to marshal international support on Karabakh and counter Armenian diaspora influence in the West, particularly in the United States and France. Indeed, because Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea calls into question the borders of the former Soviet republics\u2014which the republics recognize as state borders under the Alma-Ata Declaration of December 21, 1991\u2014it also calls into question the basis for Azerbaijani claims to sovereignty over Nagornyy Karabakh. Moreover, for the last fifteen years, proposed principles for a negotiated peace in the Karabakh conflict have included a \u201cbinding expression of the popular will\u201d as part of the ultimate disposition of the territory. The Russia-staged referendum in Crimea drove home to the Azerbaijanis how easy it is for the power with boots on the ground to ensure its desired outcome in such a vote. All in all, since 2014, Azerbaijan has become, if anything, even more transactional in its approach to Russia. The 2016 offensive in Karabakh, which might earlier have been deterred by reluctance to antagonize Russia, can be seen as one example. The fighting Azerbaijan initiated on September 27, 2020, can also be seen as a transaction with Russia\u2014one made possible by Turkish intervention. To be sure, one aim of the offensive is to regain territory and therefore remove bargaining chips from Armenia\u2019s side of the board. But perhaps the larger aim is to threaten Putin with instability and possibly a region-wide war if he does not force deep concessions on Armenia. Aliyev ignored Lavrov\u2019s initial offer: the return of two provinces, in exchange for Russia being allowed to deploy a peacekeeping force. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that to Azerbaijan, Russia is now less of a partner and more of a problem to be solved. Azerbaijan tries to solve its Russia problem through closer relations with, in particular, Turkey and China. Turkey has long been Azerbaijan\u2019s main advocate in the international sphere. Aside from ethnic kinship (a significant Azeri population lives in Eastern Turkey) and deep historical links before the Soviet takeover, Turkey is quick to cite certain protectorate rights granted under the Treaties of Moscow and Kars (1921). Since independence, Azerbaijan has seen Turkey as a counterweight to Russian power. At present, however, Turkey has its own complex relations with Russia. Turkey enjoys the positive effects of continued close energy and pipeline relations, as well as personal interactions between Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan; but offsetting these effects are sharp differences between Turkey and Russia on the conflicts in Syria and Libya. Azerbaijan seeks to ensure that Turkey\u2019s support vis-\u00e0-vis Russia is unwavering. Turkey\u2019s support of Azerbaijan and reported direct military involvement in the autumn 2020 fighting have granted Azerbaijan unprecedented room for maneuver vis-\u00e0-vis Russia\u2014both on the battlefield and with regard to Russian mediation efforts. It took the Kremlin almost two weeks to arrange a Putin-Aliyev phone call; a humanitarian truce brokered by Lavrov fell apart almost immediately. China has increased its engagement with the Caucasus as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, though neither its trade nor investment in the region compare with its far more massive engagement in Central Asia. Its main partner in the region is Azerbaijan, which has the largest population, economy, and reserves of natural resources. The partnership makes sense geopolitically as well: although China is now a major trading partner for Armenia and Georgia, Armenia is too dependent on Russia to be pried loose and China is probably wary of Russian sensitivities on Georgia. China has now become the third largest source of imports for Azerbaijan, after Russia and Turkey. Azerbaijan presents the most potential for future political rapprochement, and China, unlike the West, is not burdened with concerns over Azerbaijan\u2019s human rights record. Azerbaijan hopes that as the Belt and Road Initiative progresses, China will increase its use of Azerbaijan for the transit of cargo to Europe\u2014floating cargo across the Caspian and loading it onto the railroad link opened in 2017 between Baku and Kars, in Turkey, via Georgia. Putin once famously declared that he would hang Saakashvili by his testicles. That promise remains unfulfilled, but not for want of trying. Saakashvili lost his parliamentary majority in 2012 and was voted out of office in 2013. If Putin thought Saakashvili\u2019s ouster by the billionaire (and, until shortly before then, Russian citizen) Bidzina Ivanishvili and his Georgian Dream Party would liberate a wellspring of affection for Russia, he was in for disappointment. The Georgian populace remains deeply suspicious of Russia. In late 2014, NATO initiated a major assistance program, the Substantial NATO-Georgia Package, sharply ramping up security cooperation with the Georgian Dream government. Russia\u2019s hostile and aggressive policy toward Georgia, too, remains unchanged. As always, the pressure point between Russia and Georgia has been separatism, namely the Russia-backed polities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In the run-up to Putin\u2019s return to the presidency, long-serving local officials in many areas controlled by Russia, especially in the Russia-supported South Ossetia and Abkhazia (and Transdniestria, outside the region), were ousted, with Moscow backing newcomers who had little local support and who would owe loyalty and obedience to Putin alone. At the end of 2011, Edmund Kokoity, who had ruled South Ossetia since 2001, was forced to resign from the leadership and was ultimately replaced by Leonid Tibilov, a veteran of the KGB. In Abkhazia, the death of Sergei Bagapsh in May 2011 triggered a premature power struggle that threw the plans off track; in the elections that followed, Moscow\u2019s chosen candidate, Raul Khajimba, was defeated. However, with the intervention of Putin\u2019s fixer Vladislav Surkov, president Alexander Ankvab was ousted in June 2014 and Khajimba was installed. By then, Russia had occupied and annexed Crimea and had instigated and supported armed separatist uprisings in Donbass, as well as Kharkiv and Odessa; in response, the West had imposed sanctions. Perhaps this left Putin and his regime less concerned with placating Western opinion, and he moved to annex the separatists in all but name. As early as October 13, 2014\u2014the month after Khajimba\u2019s inauguration\u2014Russia presented Abkhazia with a draft Treaty of Alliance, Integration and Partnership, whose main points were the takeover of key executive departments of the Abkhaz \u201cstate\u201d by their Russian homologues, with, at best, nominal Abkhazian security institutions serving as a fig leaf. Russia presented South Ossetia with a draft comprising identical terms at about the same time, though the first public announcement came in November. In the treaties that were eventually signed, the Abkhaz won face-saving concessions from the Russians; it took four drafts before the South Ossetians signed, but their version was closer to the Russian original. (The close informal relations between South Ossetia and North Ossetia made the words on paper less important.) The stifling embrace of Moscow\u2014and the suspected poisoning of Khajimba\u2019s electoral rival \u2014led to the ouster of Khajimba in early 2020 and his replacement by Aslan Bzhania, himself a veteran of the KGB. In South Ossetia, Anatoliy Bibilov, who had floated between the North and South Ossetian militaries, defeated Tibilov. Russian actions have continued to ensure that Georgian resentment over the remains an open wound. The process of borderization continues in South Ossetia: Russian border troops periodically erect new border fences that enclose bits of land hitherto under Georgian control. In July 2015, new border fences cut off part of the strategic Baku-Supsa oil pipeline, the line that carried Azerbaijani \u201cearly oil\u201d to market in the West before the main Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline was completed. Russia has not interfered with the oil flow, but the implied threat is clear. For its part, it appears that Georgia under Saakashvili tried to return this threat by reopening links with Chechen and Islamist rebel groups in the North Caucasus, as Shevardnadze had done with the Chechen commander Gelayev in 2001. Russia charged in 2009\u2014and again in 2012 after a murky incident in the Lopota Gorge (between the Pankisi Gorge and Dagestan)\u2014that Georgia was arming and training Chechen militants to fight inside Russia. In 2017, several years after Saakashvili was replaced by the less anti-Russian Georgian Dream Party, the Chechen commander involved in the Lopota incident was killed by Georgian security forces in Tbilisi. Thus, a cycle of perceived provocations followed by emotional reactions and retaliations continues today. Most recently, a Russian\u2019s mere choice of seating at a meeting led to crisis between the two countries. From June 19 to 23, 2019, the Interparliamentary Assembly on Orthodoxy met in the parliament in Tbilisi with Orthodox parliamentarians from many countries in attendance. This was presumably intended as a gesture at reconciliation between the Orthodox majorities of Russia and Georgia. On June 20, a member of the Russian State Duma presided over the session and sat in the Georgian parliament chair\u2019s seat. Violent street protests immediately broke out in Tbilisi, disrupting the meeting and forcing the resignation of Georgia\u2019s parliament chair the following day. Amid continuing protests against Russia in Tbilisi, Putin ordered the cessation of direct flights between Georgia and Russia\u2014as he had in the run-up to the 2008 war. The incident highlights that symbols of power relations evoke both charged emotions and material retaliations and that the pattern of events will be repeated for the foreseeable future. It is hard not to conclude that Putin\u2019s personal overreach in Ukraine has led to suboptimal results for Russia in the South Caucasus. When he resumed the presidency of Russia, Putin increased engagement with the South Caucasus, perhaps hoping to gather some castaway stones closer into the Russian camp. By autumn, 2013, everything seemed to be going his way: Armenia (and Ukraine) had bowed to his demands to reject association agreements with the EU and to sign on instead with the EAEU that Putin had singlehandedly created, promoted, and dominated. Relations with Azerbaijan were on an even keel without much expenditure of effort. And Georgia\u2019s despised Saakashvili had been replaced by a Russian billionaire whose government was floating trial balloons about normalizing relations with Moscow despite Russia\u2019s recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. But relations with all three South Caucasus countries reverted to type after Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine. Moscow\u2019s stifling embrace of rulers such as Sargsyan and Khajimba led to popular discontent and their forcible ousters. The precedents set on Ukrainian territory led Azerbaijan to proceed with extreme caution in its relations with Russia. And Russia\u2019s expansionist policies with regard to Abkhazia and South Ossetia have guaranteed the hostility of the Georgian populace and repudiation by what might have been a friendlier government. As observers have noted, major outside powers such as China, Turkey, and the EU have capitalized on local suspicions of Russia. They have developed strong interests in all three South Caucasus countries and have the wherewithal to defend those interests against Russian maneuvering, while also providing the locals with greater room for maneuver. Turkey\u2019s willingness to take a major military role in support of Azerbaijan in the fighting that began September 27 shows that Russian power no longer has the deterrent effect it once did against intervention by outside powers. Russian interests themselves are not yet seriously threatened, but expansion of those interests has been blunted. One can say, then, that Russia\u2019s policies in the South Caucasus and in the wider post-Soviet space have forced it back on the stony path it had been treading for a generation and will probably tread for some time to come.

{"text": "Giuliani\u2019s dirty tricks are the scandal, not Hunter Biden\u2019s hard drive. The Treasury Department last month imposed sanctions on four people linked to Russia for attempting to influence the presidential election, including a Ukrainian parliamentarian named Andriy Derkach, who has worked with Donald Trump\u2019s consigliere Rudy Giuliani to smear Joe Biden. , Derkach has been \u201can active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian intelligence services.\u201d The Treasury said Derkach had worked covertly to cultivate \u201cfalse and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 presidential election\u201d \u2014 an obvious reference to Biden. Derkach had released \u201cedited audiotapes and other unsupported information\u201d and managed to push his \u201cunsubstantiated narratives\u201d into Western media. According to The Washington Post, U.S. intelligence agencies last year that Giuliani, then searching in Ukraine for dirt about Biden and his son Hunter, was the target of a Russian influence operation. \u201cThe Russians have been cultivating Rudy Giuliani as an asset for over a year,\u201d Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told me. \u201cAny information proffered by Rudy Giuliani is likely compromised.\u201d That, of course, did not stop The New York Post from publishing a series of breathless articles about Hunter Biden purportedly based on a hard drive that fell into Giuliani\u2019s hands. Some of the stories \u2014 like one about Hunter\u2019s anguished texts to his father from rehab \u2014 seem intended to wound Joe Biden by humiliating his child. Others were meant to resurrect the that Joe Biden pressed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor to help Burisma, an energy company that had Hunter Biden on its board. So far, the Hunter Biden laptop affair is a farcical retread of the Russian hack-and-leak operation that helped torpedo Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential aspirations in 2016. Now, as then, the Trump campaign appears to be hoping that the media will dribble out stolen private messages over the final weeks of the campaign, creating an illusion of scandal where none exists. And now, as then, someone in Trump\u2019s inner circle is working directly with someone who is, at least according to the U.S. government, a Russian agent. Since The New York Post began publishing its Hunter Biden articles, there\u2019s been an escalating chorus of conservative whining about the mainstream media\u2019s refusal to pick up its reporting. \u201cMedia avoiding The Post\u2019s Hunter Biden stories as much as Joe,\u201d says the headline on a Most reputable reporters aren\u2019t taking the bait; Giuliani\u2019s trove is just too sketchy. , the journalist who wrote one of The Post\u2019s big Hunter Biden stories refused to put his byline on it out of concerns about the credibility of the underlying information. that Giuliani initially offered the data to Fox News, but \u201cthe news division chose not to run the story unless or until the sourcing and veracity of the emails could be properly vetted.\u201d The provenance of the alleged hard drive is murky, and the F.B.I. is whether it\u2019s linked to a foreign disinformation campaign. Giuliani claims his lawyer got it from a Delaware computer repair shop owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, who says someone he thinks was Hunter Biden dropped off three laptops and never picked them up. Mac Isaac gave a halting interview to several journalists last week; , so you can hear for yourself as his story shifts over the course of an hour. If there\u2019s an important story here, it\u2019s almost certainly about Giuliani\u2019s dirty tricks, not any wrongdoing by Joe Biden. Reporting on disinformation is complicated, because it\u2019s hard to write about it without amplifying it. Still, this episode distills just how far Trump has dragged the country down in four years. In 2016, the public didn\u2019t know that Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was passing polling data to someone tied to the Russian intelligence directorate \u2014 such a revelation would have been devastating. Giuliani\u2019s relationship with Derkach, by contrast, is out in the open. he thinks there\u2019s only a 50 percent chance that his Ukrainian collaborator is really a Russian spy, and that it wouldn\u2019t matter to him if his Hunter Biden material was linked to Russian hacking. This barely made a ripple. \u201cIt\u2019s collusion in broad daylight,\u201d said Murphy. Giuliani probably can\u2019t sabotage Biden the way WikiLeaks sabotaged Clinton. The Clinton leak was damaging because many voters already believed there was something sinister about her hidden emails. Burisma never stuck to Biden in the same way, so there\u2019s less payoff in forcing it back into the news. But Giuliani\u2019s tactics aren\u2019t any less foul for being ineffective. It\u2019s hardly surprising that the president\u2019s bottom-feeding lawyer has shown himself open to working with Russian intelligence. It\u2019s striking, though, that no one expects better. "},

As it turns out, Russia can be both a symbol and an external actor able to influence domestic processes. It is important to resist the temptation to conflate different preoccupations In recent years, a certain preoccupation with Russia has featured frequently in journalistic reporting and opinion pieces in Western media. This has partly been related to its aggressive foreign policy, its role in returning war to Europe, and its military involvement in the Middle East. But Russia's alleged involvement in domestic politics well outside its neighbourhood and well into the core of Western democracies has perhaps stirred even more debate. This trend has been particularly noticeable in the aftermath of the 2016 electoral contests that brought Donald Trump to the White House and Brexit to the UK, with references to Russian meddling - including disinformation campaigns waged through social media and hacking-and-dumping operations - becoming ever more common. A certain preoccupation with Russia's influence and interference in domestic politics in Europe slightly pre-dates those momentous elections, and relates instead to the increasingly cosy relationship between Moscow and radical right-wing movements and political parties in Europe. The multi-layered dynamics that opened the way for the far-right's fascination with the Kremlin, and pushed the Kremlin and its associates to pro-actively engage with such forces, are described in detail in a 2017 book by Anton Shekhovtsov, Far-right politicians have not kept hidden their support for Russia's president Vladimir Putin, both by boasting about their direct contacts - as for example - and simply by proclaiming it very explicitly, as e.g. , including by sporting Putin t-shirts. This combination of trends has contributed to heating up debates about Russia and sometimes turning them into hyper-partisan affairs. At least in part, this is due to the fact that expressions of concern about Russia often conflate quite different preoccupations that ultimately coincide with the perceived crisis of Western liberal-democratic institutions and political forces. Blaming structural crises on foreign interference and on externally-generated disinformation is tempting (and Vladimir Putin makes for a good, headline-grabbing, archvillain), but may be a poor starting point both for analysis and for developing policy responses. Yet, this understanding does not negate the importance of having an honest conversation about Russia. Or probably, more than one. If Russia should not be a central character in the story about disinformation and lack of trust in institutions and electoral processes across the West, what kind of conversation about Russia's impact on domestic politics in Italy and other European countries should we have? There is a number of ways Russia matters to the domestic political conversation in a country such as Italy. Let's start from a Russia that does not really exixst, but that nonetheless seems to be a powerful pole of attraction. Many, in particular on the far-right, seem to see in a stereotyped version of Russia's Vladimir Putin a role model: a strongman who puts national interests first, who makes fast and effective decisions without concerns about the burden of checks and balances, who does not need to care about political correctness and human rights, who does not bow to international pressures, and can protect so-called \u201ctraditional values\u201d. This is, of course, a fantasy, full of contraddictions and distant from reality. Nonetheless, there is no denying that this is a powerful fantasy with widespread appeal. Interestingly, this is a narrative carefully created by Russia's leadership for domestic purposes to higlight the stark contrasts with the dysfunctional 1990s - hard post-perestroika years when the internal frailty of the Russian state became most visible and living standards fell disastrously for the vast majority of residents. Originally, this narrative was not anti-Western nor particularly socially conservative, but it increasingly became so in recent years. Homophobic discourse (and legislation) appeared more distinctly in the last decade, and became an important talking point, for example, of the campaigns opposing the EU association agreements in Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. By leveraging this and other conservative tropes as well as an anti-liberal and anti-Western rhetoric, contemporary Russia with Putin at its helm became a symbol for the global right. But is it still really Russia that we are talking about? Arguably, to the extent that this preoccupation revolves around the rise of the radical right, right-wing populism, and diminishing trust in the institutions at the core of liberal democracies, then Russia is itself marginal, if not as a token. Symbols of course do matter, but in both analytical and policy terms - to understand this trend, and to contrast it - focusing on Russia may not be not very useful. There is, however, a common counter-argument to this proposition: Russia, it is argued, is not only a symbol but also an active enabler of such political forces. It supports them not only financially, but also by favouring the spread of disinformation and by using influence operations to exacerbate social divisions and polarise the public debate around wedge issues: this is what Russian meddling is about. exposed by the preoccupation with Russian meddling - including online disinformation, the role of dark money in politics, and issues of cybersecurity - is the most fruitful way to protect democratic institutions and processes from both domestic and external spoilers. However, with mounting evidence pointing at how actors associated with the Russian government do engage in such activities, a focus on the vulnerabilities does not imply complacency about the instances when Russia is part of the problem: quite on the contrary, identifying specific causes for concern contributes to define better what \u201cRussia\u201d we are talking about. Finally, a meaningful conversation about Russia and its role in domestic issues in Western democracies cannot ignore the actual country, the Russian Federation, with its long history of both cultural and economic relationships with European countries, its foreign policy, and its soft power. In Italy, for example, governments of all colours and stripes have maintained relatively friendly relations with Moscow in recent years, even while remaining within the boundaries of the shared foreign policy agreed with its traditional allies, including for example by supporting EU sanctions after Russia's annexation of Crimea (journal articles by The impact of these dynamics on domestic political dynamics may be limited, but quite possibly not negligible in some policy areas, such as for example energy and environmental policies. Does the close relationship between key players in the energy sectors in Italy and Russia hinder the development of a more ambitious energy policy, including a full committment to abandon fossil fuels as soon as possible? Potentially, influence on a such an important policy area may be more consequential in the long term than other forms of \u201cRussian meddling\u201d. Concerns about the impact of Russia on domestic processes in Western democracies often lead to conversations in which Russia is ultimately not the protagonist. In some of them, Russia remains however an important actor. Focusing on Russia's role rather than conflating Russia with a large set of preoccupations is an important step in having a more meaningful public conversation about the multi-layered crisis that questions the very nature of liberal democracies.

{"text": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s Friday night in Moscow, and popular bars and restaurants in the city center are packed. No one except the staff is wearing a mask or bothers to keep their distance. There is little indication at all that Russia is being swept by a resurgence of coronavirus infections. \u201cI believe that everyone will have the disease eventually,\u201d says Dr. Alexandra Yerofeyeva, an internal medicine specialist at an insurance company, while sipping a cocktail at The Bix bar in Moscow. She adds cheerfully: \u201cNothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d The outbreak in Russia this month is breaking the records set in the spring, when a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus was put in place. But, as , authorities in Russia are resisting shutting down businesses again. Some regions have closed nightclubs or limited the hours of bars and restaurants, but few measures have been implemented in Moscow, which is once again the epicenter of the surge. On Friday, Russian authorities reported over 15,000 new infections, the highest daily spike so far in the pandemic. Moscow \u2014 with less than 10% of the population \u2014 accounts for up to 30% of new infections each day. The health minister says 90% of hospital beds for coronavirus patients have been filled. Three times this week, Russia\u2019s daily death toll exceeded the spring record of 232. Even these soaring virus tolls are likely undercounts; experts have cautioned that official figures around the world understate the true toll, but critics have , alleging authorities might be playing down the scale of the outbreak. Right now, situation is \u201cdifficult\u201d but \u201cno restrictive measures for the economy are required,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova told President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The spring lockdown hurt the country\u2019s already weakened economy and compounded Russians\u2019 frustration with plummeting incomes and worsening living conditions, driving Putin\u2019s approval rating to a historic low of 59% in April, according to the Levada Center, Russia\u2019s top independent pollster. Analysts say his government doesn\u2019t want to return to those darks days. \u201cThey know that people have just come to the end of their tolerance of the lockdown measures that would be hugely unpopular if they got imposed again,\u201d said Judy Twigg, a professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University, specializing in global health. In fact, Putin\u2019s government appears to be moving in the opposite direction. Russian officials announced this week that air traffic would resume with three more countries. All international air traffic was stopped in the spring. The announcement reminded people \u201cabout the necessity to take care of their health as much as possible\u201d \u2014 a reflection of Russian authorities\u2019 new effort to shift much of the responsibility for how the outbreak unfolds onto the people. Moscow has taken the necessary measures, \u201cbut without the people responding to these measures, helping themselves and the people around them, nothing will work,\u201d warned Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of the Russian capital of 12.7 million. During the summer, authorities lifted most virus-related restrictions, and life in Russia started getting back to normal. Perhaps too quickly, some critics said, noting that the government was eager to ensure that people voted on constitutional amendments extending Putin\u2019s rule. Even as health officials still report several thousand new infections every day, restaurants and cinemas reopened, vacationers flocked to Black Sea resorts, and 17,000 took part in the Moscow Half Marathon in August. Russia\u2019s Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin said the race \u201cmarked this victory\u201d over the pandemic. That same month, Putin announced regulatory approval of the first vaccine against coronavirus \u2014 although and it is now being tested in a larger study. Authorities are offering it to doctors and teachers, but it\u2019s not widely available. With Putin\u2019s approval ratings on the rise again, the government appears reluctant to do anything that might further weaken the economy and anger the public. The authorities understand that \u201cthe economic virus is worse than the biological one,\u201d Boris Titov, Russia\u2019s business ombudsman, told entrepreneurs this week. Nearly 70% of the country\u2019s businesses \u201cwill not survive the second wave\u201d and the accompanying restrictions, he said. But doctors and experts are sounding the alarm that Russia\u2019s health system is being stretched. Just like in the spring, media report hourslong waits for ambulances and long lines for CT scans. People who have virus symptoms \u2014 who are supposed to call a visiting doctor service \u2014 report waiting days for anyone to arrive. \u201cWhen it comes to the regions (beyond Moscow), we see that they are already choking,\u201d said Vasily Vlassov, public health expert with the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Moscow hospitals, so far, appear to be coping. \u201cThe hospital is full, but there are free beds for now, and we haven\u2019t yet used all of the reserve beds,\u201d said Dr. Alexander Vanyukov of the Moscow Hospital No. 52. Life outside hospitals remains largely normal. Moscow officials have recommended the elderly and those with chronic illnesses stay home. They ordered employers to make 30% of their staff work from home, extended the fall school vacation by a week and moved middle and high school students to online classes. As at the national level, officials have focused on personal responsibility, at one point sending inspectors to theaters to look for retirees who are not self-isolating. Officials said they considered shutting bars and nightclubs, but on Thursday Moscow\u2019s mayor proposed \u201can experiment\u201d instead: Employees and customers at establishments open between midnight and 6 a.m. must register for contact tracing purposes. Margo Lankina, manager of The Bix bar, says operating during the pandemic isn\u2019t easy. Her staff must wear gloves and masks and their health is monitored. The venue is regularly cleaned. \u201cBut on the other hand, it\u2019s good that they allow us to work,\u201d Lankina says. \u201cOur guests? Well, the distance is not being observed, that\u2019s true, what can I say?\u201d Lankina admits. \u201cBut somehow we keep on living.\u201d Associated Press writer Kostya Manenkov contributed.

{"text": "As with many contemporary issues of its foreign and security policy, history influences Moscow\u2019s attitudes towards Afghanistan. Since the 19th century, Afghanistan has been an object of competition between Russia and other global powers. A particularly interesting example is to Kabul in 1878, during the era of the \u201c \u201d between the Russian and British empires. The two empires and the other great powers of Europe were meeting at the time at the Berlin Congress, which followed the Russian-Turkish War of 1877 to 1878, and to the Afghan capital was a means of exerting pressure on Britain half a world away at the Congress. to kill U.S. and allied soldiers reveal both that Afghanistan is still a site of competition between Russia and the West, and that a need still exists to understand what Russia desires and expects from its contemporary policy in Afghanistan. The aim here is to explore the determinants, goals, and approaches of Russia\u2019s Afghanistan policy during recent years. This analysis intends to explain Russia\u2019s vision of relations with and the significance of Afghanistan for Russia\u2019s international and security policy. Drawing primarily on official Russian sources as well as the statements of Russian political elites and experts, I intend to explain the trends, changes, and developments in Russia\u2019s Afghanistan policy. Russia\u2019s current Afghan policy reflects its main priorities regarding the region, such as maintaining its influence and preventing U.S. military bases in the region, and also its temporary interests, such as challenging the United States amidst worsening relations between Moscow and Washington. Moscow also assumes the Taliban will play a huge role in the country in coming years, and therefore aims to be on good terms with the Taliban. Russia\u2019s interests in Afghanistan center on ensuring the security and preventing the destabilization of the Afghan-Central Asian border area. Three of these Central Asian countries \u2014 Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan \u2014 are Russian allies within the framework of the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Eurasian Economic Union. is Russia\u2019s leading military alliance, and started with an agreement signed in May 1992. It currently has six members: Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. is a Moscow-led international organization for regional economic integration, and was established by the Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union in the end of 2014. Its member-states are Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. An additional Russian policy goal is to keep Afghanistan as a neutral state that cannot be used as a launching pad by other powers, especially the United States, against Russia. Afghanistan\u2019s geographic location \u2014 in the region \u2014 attracts Russia as it seeks to play a major role in Eurasia. , it does try to ensure its economic interests in Afghanistan for when a peace resolution is achieved. It should be noted that although a stable Afghanistan would align with Russia\u2019s interests, Moscow vital interests (economic or otherwise) in this country. Since the end of the 1990s, Russia has perceived the main threats emanating from Afghanistan to be the potential for the export of radical ideology; terrorism and narcotics; the penetration of Afghan military groups in Central Asia and destabilization of those countries; and the American military presence in Afghanistan and its influence over Central Asian states. However, while the export of terrorism and the penetration of military groups could have in the past been perceived as real concerns, their current threat has been exaggerated by Russian officials and several experts. A direct military threat against Russia from Afghanistan does not exist and probably will not for any foreseeable future. There will be no direct military threat to Russia, even power in Kabul and takes control of the entire country \u2014 including the northern regions. Therefore, Russian urge that it is not only dangerous for Russia to get involved in the intra-Afghan struggle for power, but pointless. Rather, Moscow should be working with potential leaders in Kabul and maintaining contact with any regional or ethnic groups that are not involved in direct actions against it. is one of Russia\u2019s primary means for reducing domestic drug use. Russia has one of the A significant portion of those narcotics This goal of eliminating drug trafficking is one reason why at the end of the 2000s, Russian officials criticized U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan for failing to fight against narcotic production and distribution. In a list of Afghan and Central Asian drug barons and others involved in the drug trade, as well operating in Afghanistan, to the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy and to NATO. Moscow subsequently sought the forceful eradication of opium poppy fields in Afghanistan. Moscow\u2019s , as there were no alternative income possibilities available to the peasant population, and both the Afghan government and U.S.-led coalition refused. However, in October 2010, the United States and Russia conducted near the Pakistani border. Moscow\u2019s motives on this front are not solely health-based: It uses the problem of drug production in Afghanistan in \u201cinformation confrontations\u201d with the United States, as evidenced by the recent statements made by a Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs official direct threats from Afghanistan are not mentioned, though both documents do cite terrorism and drug trafficking as central threats to the state and public security. Moreover, in Russia\u2019s 2016 (the most recent), Afghanistan is mentioned as one of its regional foreign policy priorities. It should be noted that Russian resources in Afghanistan are quite limited. While Russia has historically had economic and cultural relations with the Central Asian countries and currently participates in alliances with some of them, there are several complicated issues limiting Moscow\u2019s resources and influence. Political leadership in those countries try to balance themselves between Russia, the United States, and most recently, China. The Russian military presence in the region is relatively small and the country cannot project power over the whole region. There are no reliable borders or geographical barriers between Afghanistan and Russian territory that could ultimately stop an infiltration of military groups into Russian territory. Although Russia\u2019s central and southern military districts have enough capabilities to defeat challenges from the Afghanistan direction, they have caused by underdeveloped railway lines in the region. In spite of these difficulties, that radical groups based in Afghanistan have the capability to penetrate Central Asia at any time in the foreseeable future. However, official Moscow perceives it as a threat. Moscow does have opportunities to influence regional security. Some tools, for example, are: targeted diplomacy within Afghanistan and with regional powers, especially China, India, Iran, and Pakistan; Russian military bases in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan; and regional institutions such as the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( totals some 18,000 servicemen and is the main instrument in emergency situations) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Considering its historical experience, understanding of the economic and military burdens of any direct military involvement, and relative inability to influence internal groups, Moscow has since the early 2010s decided to seek diplomatic solutions to influence developments in Afghanistan. In doing so, Russia has become one of the main actors in the peace process. Moscow has undertaken several initiatives. In two of the peace initiatives \u2014 \u2014 Russia acts either as the main organizer or as a host and sponsor. A third effort is a joint initiative, dialogue, which grew out of the U.S.-Russian dialogue on Afghanistan, which expanded in the summer of 2019 with the participation of . Moreover, Moscow continues to dialogue with Washington and since 2019, for Afghanistan began to meet regularly. Moscow also uses some other diplomatic initiatives, such as , which was revived on Oct. 11, 2017 when it met at the level of deputy foreign ministers in Moscow. Russia seeks to use the Moscow format as a platform for consultations at the Eurasian level. It started in in the form of trilateral consultations between Russia, China, and Pakistan. On April 14, 2017, the third round was held, and what had been formally referred to as \u201cconsultations\u201d were upgraded to the \u201cMoscow conference on the Afghan settlement.\u201d For the first time, Russia, China, and Pakistan together called on the Taliban to negotiate with the Afghan government. Diplomats from 11 states (Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, China, India, and all five Central Asian countries) attended. took part in the next meeting of the Moscow format in Nov. 2018. (Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai established the Peace Council to negotiate with the Taliban in September 2010 and its secretariat was dissolved by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai on July 27, 2019, with ) The first meetings on the Afghan settlement, which took place in Moscow in December 2016, . Thus, the first round of trilateral consultations on regional issues, held in Moscow on Dec. 27, 2016 with the participation of representatives from Russia, China, and Pakistan, prompted the for a meeting without the participation of the Afghan government delegation. negotiations between the United States and Taliban, while simultaneously looking askance at any U.S.-led peace initiatives. For instance, Ghani\u2019s peace talks \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d with the Taliban in February 2018 were skeptically received by Zamir Kabulov, the Russian president\u2019s special representative to Afghanistan. According to 2018 remarks by , Russia considers the Moscow format to be the optimal platform for promoting national reconciliation in Afghanistan because it included the Taliban, while other initiatives did not help to involve the Taliban in the talks. At the same time, he stressed that Moscow considers the Kabul conference as a key element in the search for a collective solution to the Afghan settlement problems. It should be noted that Kabulov\u2019s statement regarding the approaches of other external players in the Afghan peace process came several days before another meeting (not led by Russia, and thus a subject of Russian grievance) on the Afghan peace settlement, on Afghanistan, on March 27, 2018. In 2020, Russia has received U.S. Secretary of State Mike to Central Asia and the new negatively. Prior to Pompeo\u2019s visit, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov negatively assessed U.S. activity in the region, saying that America\u2019s true goal is \u201c The informal inter-Afghan dialogue in Moscow was organized by Russia under the auspices of Afghan diaspora organizations in Russia. In , leaders of several major movements and factions of the former Afghan Northern Alliance, mujahideen groups, and the Taliban met in Moscow to discuss the prospects for peace in Afghanistan. All of this happened despite the fact that the Taliban continue to be on of designated terrorist organizations. Most important was the fact that Russia organized a parallel dialogue platform to Western-led initiatives. that the inter-Afghan meeting was the idea of Russian leadership and is intended to compete with the negotiation process launched by the United States. According to the Russian scholar Ekaterina Stepanova, regarding negotiations over the settlement of the Afghan conflict. The first strategy is the regionalization of Russian policy on Afghanistan aimed at intensifying dialogue, coordination, and interaction with the main regional powers (Iran, China, India, and Pakistan). She notes that the decreasing presence of the United States and NATO by the mid-2010s and the gradual decline of Western influence in the region only contributed to the further \u201cregionalization\u201d of Russian politics. The second strategy is Russia\u2019s turn towards more active diplomatic support for a negotiated Afghan settlement. The combination of these two strategies has found its practical embodiment in the form of the Moscow format of regional peace consultations on Afghanistan. However, it should be noted that Russia\u2019s main goal in conducting parallel dialogues to the United States was to gain influence over the internal and external negotiation processes on Afghanistan, and that this all happened amidst increasing competition between Russia and the United States. Since the end of the 2000s, . In this respect, developing relations with the Taliban is perceived by Moscow as one of the significant facets necessary to increase its influence in internal and international competition in Afghanistan. Moreover, by the mid-2010s, the emergence of the Islamic State group posed a serious challenge to the supremacy of the Taliban and also encouraged Russia, China, and Iran \u2014 who were all fearful of any Islamic State expansion \u2014 to review their policies and open dialogues with the Taliban. In December 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan stated that the interests of the Taliban in the fight against the Islamic State in Afghanistan \u201c of Russia.\u201d He also confirmed that communication channels between Russia and the Taliban did exist. that when Taliban forces were expelled in 2001, the level of terrorist activity was reduced to zero in Afghanistan, \u201cbut now, as a result of the massive American presence\u201d there is a strategic threat for Russia, China, India, Central Asia, and Iran. , contact between Moscow and the Taliban has existed since the 1990s. Attempts by the Taliban in the 1990s to communicate with Moscow led to a single, closed meeting of Russian diplomats with former Taliban leader Mullah Omar\u2019s representative in Ashgabat. This meeting had no sequel because the Taliban asked the Russian government for assistance in replacing the representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations with a representative from the Taliban instead. The request seemed inappropriate to Russia due to the negative attitudes of the Russian political elite towards the Taliban between the 1990s and mid-2010s. For instance, predicted that the Taliban, if not stopped, would soon reach the Russian city of Samara. In 2009, then Russia\u2019s permanent representative to NATO, that if the coalition forces were defeated, the Taliban might fall to temptation and hit the north, then move towards Central Asia, which would subsequently pose a huge threat to Russia. The recognition of the by the Taliban in January 2000 and the opening of the Chechen embassy in Kabul as a result of Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev\u2019s visit to Afghanistan (who was an acting president of the breakaway Chechen Republic of Ichkeria between 1996 and 1997), further tightened Russia\u2019s position against the Taliban. that Russia was seeking to establish relations with some Taliban groups in Afghanistan, and there were regarding the importance of improving relations, not solely with government representatives but also with various Pashtun groups. Furthermore, in May 2009, took part in the \u201cRussian-Afghan Forum\u201d organized by a Russian non-governmental organization in Moscow. Initially, Moscow\u2019s main goal in regards to relations with the Taliban was to use its moderate groups against organizations such as al-Qaeda and then ISIL or Islamic State-Khorasan Province in Afghanistan. According to Dubnov, taking advantage of following the news of Mullah Omar\u2019s death, Moscow wanted to partner with the Taliban group most hostile towards the Islamic State. Moscow seemed to decide that there was little chance of the United States achieving stability in Afghanistan, and that the Taliban were more than likely going to be a dominant force for the foreseeable future. The continued deterioration of relations between Russia and the United States after Moscow\u2019s intervention in Ukraine in 2014 also influenced Moscow\u2019s Afghan policy in general and its relations with the Taliban, in particular. In February 2019, commenting on the relationship between the Taliban and the Afghan government, said that such a relationship was inevitable, but emphasized that when representatives of the United States and the Taliban recently met in Qatar, Russia and the regional countries were not informed. In early 2018, the head of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, stated that , but he could not say in what quantity. Russia , and it denied the recent allegations regarding Taliban , Nicholson wrote that Russia provided small arms, ammunition, and money with the intention of sustaining the Taliban in the fight and gaining influence ahead of the anticipated withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops. Nicholson concluded at the time that the Russian assistance was calibrated: \u201c , Moscow\u2019s decision to open a channel to the Taliban, and ultimately supply the group with arms, reflected a desire to be on good terms with whoever ruled the country. Moscow has increased its diplomatic support to the Taliban in recent years. For instance, in March 2020, the United States launched air strikes in Helmand province to stop Taliban attacks on the Afghan military. called the air strikes a violation of the agreement signed in Qatar. Currently, on the Taliban in the United Nations. Moscow\u2019s attitudes towards the Taliban evolved from viewing the group as an officially forbidden terrorist organization to one of the most important internal actors of the Afghan peace settlement. This has not gone unnoticed by the Taliban, with an official representative one during an interview with Russian media. . The Kremlin seems to have abandoned its longstanding practice of de facto boycotting the Afghan central government, although it continues to use the advisory and lobbying services of the country\u2019s ex-president, Hamid Karzai \u2014 which is not welcomed by the Afghan government (relations between Ghani and Karzai are very bad). Since 1989, Russia\u2019s Afghan policy has seen several changes. Currently, it prioritizes three goals. First, to stabilize Afghanistan and to maintain Russia\u2019s strong role in the negotiations while also seeing the removal of U.S. and NATO military bases. Second, to use the Afghanistan peace process in its current confrontation with the West. And finally, Moscow considers its participation in the peace settlement as a confirmation of its return to the world\u2019s global-power competition. As Moscow assumes the Taliban will play a huge role in the country in coming years, it aims to be on good terms with Afghanistan\u2019s assumed future power brokers.

{"text": "The Russian leader claims to be conquering the pandemic, but he inhabits a virus-free bubble, rarely leaving home. The few people he meets must quarantine first. MOSCOW \u2014 The officials from a secretive Russian security force seemed to know exactly what they wanted when they reached out to Olga Izranova\u2019s company last spring. They wanted movable tunnels that douse people in clouds of disinfectant. \u201cThey said it had to be done very fast,\u201d Ms. Izranova recalls. She admits the tunnels are of limited efficacy in the coronavirus pandemic, but for her most important customer, every bit counts. The Federal Protective Service, Russia\u2019s answer to the Secret Service, has helped build a virus-free bubble around President Vladimir V. Putin that far outstrips the protective measures taken by many of his foreign counterparts. Russian journalists who cover Mr. Putin have not seen him up close since March. The few people who meet him face-to-face generally spend as much as two weeks in quarantine first. The president still conducts his meetings with senior officials \u2014 including with his cabinet and his Security Council \u2014 by video link from a spartan room in his residence outside Moscow, which has been outfitted with Ms. Izranova\u2019s disinfectant tunnel. In the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia has often been compared to the United States and Brazil, two other large countries whose leaders have played down the disease\u2019s risk and saw it spiral out of control. But while President Trump and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil have chafed against restricting their own movements, Mr. Putin has retreated into an intricate cocoon of social distancing \u2014 even as he has allowed life in Russia to essentially return to normal. The contrast between the behavior of Mr. Putin and that of his people now looms large, as a second wave of the pandemic threatens to wash over Russia. In Moscow, where people , the number of daily reported new cases tripled to more than 2,300 in the last two weeks. As Russia lifted last spring\u2019s lockdown, Mr. Putin presided over ceremonial events that seemed designed to exude a sense of normalcy. Behind the scenes, they were anything but normal. Dozens of World War II veterans joined Mr. Putin on the risers in Red Square in June when he presided over of the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany. But before being allowed within breathing distance of Mr. Putin, the veterans had to spend two weeks in quarantine at an isolated health resort. \u201cWe went for walks, were bored, sat around and breathed the air,\u201d said Lev Litvinov, a 100-year-old veteran. The logistics proved so taxing that Mr. Litvinov did not actually make it to the parade. He said that after spending two weeks in quarantine, he got sick on the winding drive through the countryside toward Red Square, 50 miles away. He was taken instead to a health center, where he spent another week. \u201cMost importantly, this is about their health, the veterans\u2019 health,\u201d Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, of the decision to quarantine the attendees. Mr. Putin\u2019s diligence in protecting himself is striking because in communicating with the Russian public in recent months, his government largely declared the virus vanquished. \u201cI would like to congratulate you on our latest joint victory,\u201d Mayor Sergey S. Sobyanin of Moscow , announcing the end of the city\u2019s lockdown. Indoor dining at bars and restaurants resumed just two weeks later. Critics said Russia rushed to end its coronavirus restrictions in order to lift people\u2019s spirits ahead of the on constitutional amendments that opened the door to Mr. Putin remaining president until 2036. When Mr. Putin that Russia had registered the world\u2019s first coronavirus vaccine, it appeared that the country was delivering a final, crushing blow against the pandemic. \u201cThese common efforts and targeted and, as it turned out, very effective solutions have helped us to pass the peak of the epidemic and create conditions for further work,\u201d Mr. Putin in an interview with state television. Families filled Black Sea resorts and adults returned to their offices. Across the country, children went back to school on schedule on Sept. 1. But Mr. Putin remained in self-isolation. He continued to hold most of his meetings with government officials by video conference from a room in his suburban Moscow estate, Novo-Ogaryovo. The residence, like the Kremlin, has been outfitted with a disinfectant tunnel made by Ms. Izranova\u2019s industrial-cleaning equipment company, Mizotty, in the Russian city of Penza. Walking through the tunnel, she says, feels and smells like passing through a cloud of pool-water mist. Mr. Putin\u2019s video conferencing room \u2014 beige chair, walls, telephones; a Dell computer screen, blank except for a photograph of the Kremlin as the desktop background \u2014 became so familiar that state television \u201cThese are the microphones on the president\u2019s desk,\u201d the reporter intoned on the Sunday prime time show \u201cMoscow. Kremlin. Putin.\u201d \u201cWhen the indicator lights are red, sound is not transmitted.\u201d That a state television reporter got to visit and interview Mr. Putin in August was an exception. Otherwise, the Kremlin has cut off journalists\u2019 ability to see Mr. Putin in person, even for those who used to do so regularly, since March. \u201cThe work has been absolutely remote,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov, a journalist who has covered the Kremlin for Kommersant, a daily newspaper, since 2002. \u201cI know for a fact that no text journalist, myself included, has seen the president in all the days of the coronavirus.\u201d Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, did not respond to requests for comment about the president\u2019s coronavirus precautions. But Mr. Kolesnikov said he understood that the governors, business leaders and senior officials on Mr. Putin\u2019s agenda are given a choice: meet by video link or spend up to two weeks in quarantine for an in-person encounter. \u201cSince he misses real-life interaction with people, you would probably have the chance to drink tea with him afterward,\u201d in the case of an in-person meeting, Mr. Kolesnikov said. \u201cI think that they, of course, choose quarantine in that situation.\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s extreme caution reflects not only his age \u2014 he is 67, putting him at relatively high risk of severe illness from the coronavirus \u2014 but also what critics describe as paranoia honed during his former career as a K.G.B. spy. He made headlines last year at the Group of 20 summit in Japan, even as the other assembled world leaders drank from wine glasses. According to the Kremlin\u2019s website, only one person has met with Mr. Putin face-to-face more than once since April: Igor Sechin, a former K.G.B. officer and a close associate of Mr. Putin since the 1990s. He now runs Rosneft, the Russian state oil giant, and saw the president A Russian investigative news outlet, Proekt, that the authorities had set aside two large health resorts in the Black Sea city of Sochi for people quarantining before meeting Mr. Putin. In September, 30 nuclear industry workers who had quarantined in Sochi were then flown to Moscow to meet with the president \u201cSome people quarantine for two weeks, some people quarantine for a few days and some people meet without a quarantine,\u201d Mr. Peskov told reporters in response. Mr. Putin\u2019s European Union counterparts have started crisscrossing the continent again, including for . Mr. Putin, by contrast, has not gone abroad since January. Mr. Peskov hinted this week that the president would only resume foreign travel after he gets a Covid-19 vaccine. But he advised that Mr. Putin was not ready to get the shot yet, despite all the state-media bombast about Russia\u2019s world-leading achievement in developing it. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that when it comes to the head of state, special precautionary measures are in effect,\u201d Mr. Peskov Oleg Matsnev and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed research.

Russian extremists could exploit their ties with white nationalist groups in the US to foment violence around the presidential election, terrorism experts have told Business Insider. They warned that Russia's influence with white nationalists in the US is growing. They say that Russian propaganda and disinformation targeting extremists who believe that progressives are plotting to steal the election could inspire violence. The fear of election-day violence is already having consequences. are preparing for potential violence, as are , which has a contingency plan to slow inflammatory content. The experts Business Insider spoke to said that Russian extremists \u2014 with the Kremlin's tacit approval \u2014 could seek to exploit existing tensions to help them spill over into violence. \"Russia wants chaos and violence serves that, violence divides, violence reduces trust in institutions,\" said Daniel Byman, a senior foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institute in an interview with Business Insider. Jason Blazakis, a professor of terrorism studies at the Middlebury Institute in California, said that Russia is seeking to \"light the fuse\" of US white supremacy. Blazakis told Business Insider: \"It is in the Russian Federation's strategic interests to create a politically unstable United States. Cyber and disinformation efforts targeting the radical right in the United States remain part of the tool-kit \u2014 a kit that is being used to light the fuse of white supremacy.\" The 2020 presidential election is proving the most contentious in recent history. President Donald Trump has spread groundless accusation that Democrats are plotting to steal the election, and has been to far-right and white nationalist groups. In turn, they have taken encouragement from the president's anti-immigrant policies and his willingness to stoke white grievances. for supporters to monitor polling stations. One such group is accused of plotting to kidnap and murder Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. The head of the FBI, Christopher Wray, in warned that racist extremists are the most urgent domestic terror threat in the US. For years, ties have been forming between white nationalist groups in the US and Russia, the experts said. Russia's President Vladimir Putin as a bulwark against what they regard as the forces of decadent liberalism. Neo-Nazi Matthew Heimbach, one of the organisers of the 2017 Charlottesville white nationalist rally, Alex Newhouse, who researches online white nationalist propaganda, also at Middlebury, said the reverence US white nationalists feel for Russia exposes them to manipulation. \"One of the scariest parts of the developments in the information space and the extremism space over the last five years is the gradual \u2014 the pretty significant but gradual increase in pro-Russian sentiment among American white nationalist groups,\" he said. \"And that is a very specific trend that needs to be addressed. Because it does open them up to influence and manipulation.\" The relationship between Putin's Russia and America's resurgent white nationalists goes further than expressions of admiration or ideological affinity. Experts say that groups have for years been building alliances in an effort to form an international white nationalist movement. One is the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), which in April became the first white nationalist organisation to be Operating paramilitary training camps outside St Petersburg, the group aims to re-establish the old Tsarist Russian empire. According to , the group blames western culture for the \"destruction of the family and healthy moral values\" through \"abortion, propaganda of debauchery and acceptance of sexual perversions.\" Heimbach, the Charlottesville organizer, met with RIM leaders in the wake of the rally. They had travelled to the US to broker alliances with white nationalist extremists. Heimbach at the time told that the movements shared a commitment to \"conservative reactionary politics, spiritual revival, and nationalist principles.\" Blazakis, the academic, said: \"RIM has worked hand-and-glove with US-based white supremacists. \"They've invited US-based far-right ideologues to conferences to exchange ideas and tradecraft. There have long been efforts between US-RIM extremists to coordinate messaging. This is emblematic of the transnational nature of the RIM.\" , and his Traditional Workers Party has folded. Business Insider was unable to reach Heimbach for comment. A source who monitors counter-extremist groups told Business Insider that he has been keeping a low profile. In Europe, neo-Nazi extremists are known to have received training at the RIM's camps, where Russians have been trained to fight in Ukraine and Libya, Two members of the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement in 2016 and 2017 bombed a left-wing cafe and refugee center in Sweden, and tried to bomb a campsite housing refugees. They were found to have received training at a RIM camp outside St Petersburg, The group has also formed ties with extremists in Poland, Spain, Bulgaria and Austria at meetings and far-right conferences. The German government that two neo-Nazis attended RIM training in camps in Russia, which according to the State Department involves\u00a0 \"woodland and urban assault, tactical weapons, and hand-to-hand combat training.\" Blazakis said that the RIM operates with the blessing of Russian officials, even if they do not always see eye-to-eye. \"It is my assessment that the Russian Federation, at a minimum, implicitly supports the RIM. The RIM operates safe havens and training camps within the Russian Federation and does so with impunity. These training grounds have been an important avenue for far-right extremists to train,\" he said. Elizabeth Grimm, an associate professor at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, told Business Insider that supporting extremists abroad is a way that \"Russia seeks to sow discord in liberal democracies from inside the countries themselves.\" \"By highlighting divisions and hatreds that already exist in societies (including but certainly not limited to the United States and Europe), Russia advances its goal of undermining the liberal order while also maintaining plausible deniability of these efforts.\" Another recent case appears to show a direct connection between Russia's intelligence agencies and extremism in the US. that a suspected member of neo-Nazi group The Base told investigators that he believed the group's leader, Rinaldo Nazzaro, was a Russian agent. Law enforcement sources backed the man's claim. In the febrile atmosphere ahead of the US election, Russian extremists have a unique opportunity to exploit their growing influence on US white nationalists. This could be leveraged, say Grimm and Blazakis, through connections formed in training camps and far-right conferences, or through the dissemination of racist conspiracy theories and election disinformation on social media. Grimm said, that prior to its classification as a terror group, RIM ran a sophisticated social media operation, spreading racist propaganda and conspiracy theories in English on YouTube and Facebook. Since the designation, social media companies have acted to remove its channels, but the group maintains an active presence on the Russian social media site VK, and encrypted messaging app Telegram. found the RIM spreading COVID-19 disinformation, and propaganda hostile to LGBTQ people and that many extremists who were kicked off mainstream social media platforms migrated instead to Russian ones, including people from , the sprawling online movement that believes that \"deep state\" operatives are plotting against Trump. The conspiracy has inspired violent crimes by several followers and is openly supported by some Republican candidates. Newhouse said that his own research had found that QAnon rhetoric is \"rapidly merging with anti-Semitic and white supremacist rhetoric on big social media platforms and Russian-language communities.\" Civil rights non-profit the Southern Poverty Law Center between the propaganda of so-called militia groups and QAnon. On extremist online forums, links between white nationalists in Russia and the US are extensive, he said. He cited leaked data from the Iron March white supremacist forum that showed \"pretty significant patterns of reaching out and cross pollination, so to speak, between American white nationalists, white supremacists; and Russian and Ukrainian white nationalists and white supremacists.\" The Trump administration's response to these threats has been piecemeal. Earlier in September a whistleblower at the Department for Homeland Security (DHS) The State Department referred Business Insider to the FBI for comment on the combined threat posed by white nationalist extremists and Russia. The FBI declined to comment. The DHS did not respond to a request for comment. President Trump's continuing reluctance to condemn white nationalist groups, meanwhile, has been interpreted by extremists as a call to action. And the president publicly castigated FBI director Wray for addressing the threat posed by Russian interference in his congressional testimony. With Biden currently leading in the polls, Byman said that Russia is taking a big gamble in its support for white nationalists \u2014 a gamble that could backfire if an atrocity by a far-right extremist is linked to Russia, or one of the white nationalist groups in its borders. \"What happens if we find that there is an individual who was triggered by something Russia-linked? What does that mean? Does it simply get lost in the noise? Or is it that Russia becomes responsible for the deaths of several Americans?\" \"I think that Russia is playing with fire, and under Trump that hasn't been a big deal, because he has downplayed it. But under a traditional Republican or someone like Joe Biden it'd be a much bigger deal.\" "},
{"text": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russia\u2019s foreign minister warned Tuesday that Moscow could freeze its contacts with the European Union in response to its sanctions over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny \u2014 an unprecedented threat that reflects a bitter Russia-EU strain. The tough statement from Sergey Lavrov comes a day after the EU foreign ministers agreed to impose sanctions on Russian officials and organizations blamed for Navalny\u2019s poisoning with a Soviet-era nerve agent. \u201cWe probably simply have to temporarily stop talking to those people in the West who are responsible for foreign policy and don\u2019t understand the need for mutually respectful dialogue,\u201d Lavrov said at a foreign policy conference attended by experts in Moscow. He specifically pointed at European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s recent statements ruling out a partnership with Russia, saying that scenario will play out if that\u2019s what the EU wants. \u201cRussia wants to understand whether it\u2019s possible to do any business with the EU in the current conditions,\u201d Lavrov added. At Monday\u2019s meeting in Luxembourg, France and Germany urged their EU partners to freeze the assets of those suspected of involvement and ban them from traveling in Europe under sanctions to combat the use and spread of chemical weapons. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell provided no details about who might face sanctions or when the measures might come into force, but said that technical work on preparing the action will now proceed. Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator and the most visible opponent of President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia. He was flown to Germany for treatment two days later and is still recovering there. Last week, tests conducted at labs designated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed that the poison used on Navalny was a Novichok nerve agent. Navalny asserted that his poisoning only could have been ordered by spymasters who wouldn\u2019t have made such decisions without Putin\u2019s involvement The Kremlin has rejected Navalny\u2019s accusations as \u201cabsolutely groundless and unacceptable.\u201d The Kremlin also reiterated that before Navalny\u2019s transfer to Charite Hospital in Berlin, Russian labs and a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk found no sign of a poisoning. Moscow has called for Germany and the OPCW to provide its evidence, and bristled at Western leaders\u2019 insistence that Russia answer questions about what happened to the politician. "},

{"text": "Trump administration officials want to broaden the New START accord and warn that the price of a new deal will rise after the election. Joe Biden supports a straight five-year extension of the deal. President Trump had a pre-election plan to show he had gotten something out of his mysteriously friendly relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. In the weeks before the election, the two men would announce that they had reached an agreement in principle to extend New START, the last remaining major arms control agreement between the two countries. It expires on Feb. 5, two weeks after the next presidential inauguration. Mr. Trump has long refused to sign off on a clean five-year extension of the agreement, a step both leaders could take without Senate approval. He has described the Obama-era treaty as deeply flawed \u2014 the same thing he said about the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Iran nuclear accord \u2014 because it did not cover all of Russia\u2019s nuclear arms, or any of China\u2019s. But if Mr. Putin is really rooting for Mr. Trump to be re-elected, he is not acting like it. On Tuesday, Marshall Billingslea, Mr. Trump\u2019s lead negotiator, announced that the two leaders had an \u201cagreement in principle, at the highest levels of our two governments, to extend the treaty.\u201d Mr. Billingslea described an added \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to cap each country\u2019s stockpile of weapons not currently deployed on missiles, submarines or bombers. Details needed to be worked out, he cautioned, including the tricky work of verifying compliance. It sounded like a promising solution, for a few hours. Then the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, shot back that this was a figment of someone\u2019s election-season imagination. \u201cWashington is describing what is desired, not what is real,\u201d he said in a statement. For example, he said, Moscow would not freeze the number of tactical weapons it possesses. With less than three weeks to Election Day, it seems no agreement is in the offing, and Trump administration officials are saying that, after the election, the price will go up. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee who was involved in the negotiation of the original agreement in 2010, has indicated that, if elected, he will agree to a straightforward, immediate extension of the accord for five years, the maximum allowed under the current terms, and then work to expand its scope. As a result, Mr. Putin, looking at the polls, may be calculating that there is no reason to agree to any additional limits. But it also suggests that despite the C.I.A.\u2019s conclusion that , Mr. Putin may also be hedging his bets \u2014 or betting that Mr. Trump will be a private citizen by the time the treaty runs out. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to put the best face on the Russian rejection. \u201cI am hopeful that the Russians will find a way to agree to an outcome that, frankly, I think is in their best interest,\u201d he said at a news conference at the State Department. But Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, joined the Kremlin\u2019s dismissal of prospects for an agreement before the election, saying the Trump administration\u2019s one-sided announcement of a nuclear limitation deal was an \u201cunclean\u201d diplomatic maneuver. \u201cI personally don\u2019t see such a possibility,\u201d he said in an with state radio, when asked about a deal on New START. \u201cMy colleagues, who work in an interagency format and meet with the American delegation, also don\u2019t see such a possibility.\u201d The Russian pushback echoed across the government. The Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the \u201cposition of the Russian side is well known and consistent. And for now, we can\u2019t speak of any concrete agreements.\u201d Then the Russian Information Agency, a state news outlet, an article saying the Russian foreign ministry \u201ccalled the American announcement of a New START agreement with Russia nonsense and a setup.\u201d It was not the first time Mr. Putin, who worked so hard on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf in 2016, has of backing away from the president. Earlier this month, he hinted in an interview with state television at an effort to reach out to Democrats. While his goals were unclear, and with American officials cautioning that Russian disinformation may be at work, Mr. Putin spoke warmly of the Democratic Party and suggested that he could work with Mr. Biden on arms control. Analysts in Russia saw in the rejection of a pre-election nuclear deal the Kremlin preparing the ground in case Mr. Trump loses. \u201cAs the chances of a Trump re-election are increasingly remote,\u201d Pavel Felgenhauer, a military commentator for the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said in a telephone interview, \u201cwhy should we bend over backward?\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s position all year has been that the New START agreement, which limits both countries to 1,550 deployed nuclear weapons, should be extended for five years. But there are no limits on stockpiled weapons, which are essentially in storage. And that is why fears of a resumed arms race have arisen, as the United States and Russia move to improve their arsenals with new, more sophisticated weapons. , some of which have apparently run into trouble in testing, leading to The current New START treaty does not limit such work \u2014 or put limits on tactical weapons. Mr. Trump has pulled out of a series of arms control treaties, including the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, widely known as the I.N.F. And now Russia has no incentive to negotiate on tactical warheads, which it has preserved and expanded in recent decades while the U.S. abolished most of its arsenal, save for small numbers stored around Europe. \u201cRussia has an advantage in tactical weapons,\u201d Mr. Felgenhauer said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense for Russia to negotiate.\u201d There is little question that Russia had been cheating on the I.N.F. treaty\u2019s limits, and placing medium-range missiles, which appear to be armed with the tactical weapons, on its borders with Europe. The Obama administration considered abandoning the I.N.F., before deciding against it. Mr. Trump went ahead, arguing that the treaty\u2019s restrictions were keeping Washington from countering on similar weaponry that China was deploying in the Pacific. China was not a party to either New START or the I.N.F., and Mr. Trump has argued that the treaties need to be updated to account for Beijing\u2019s arms buildup. But the Chinese counter that they have around 300 nuclear weapons deployed \u2014 a fifth of the number Russia and the United States are limited to under the treaty \u2014 and that they would have no interest in any restrictions. Some Chinese officials, somewhat facetiously, have suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s initiative and then enter into arms control talks. On Beijing entering into nuclear arms talks, Mr. Pompeo expressed hopes on Wednesday \u201cthat the Chinese Communist Party will come to see that this is how mature nations deal with these issues,\u201d but he acknowledged that Chinese leaders have \u201crefused to join the conversation.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers say nothing is wrong with the idea of bringing China into arms control agreements. But they have said that abandoning New START in a failing effort to accomplish that goal would only destroy the last remaining significant limits on deployed nuclear weapons. If Mr. Biden wins, it is possible Russia could get what it wants, a straightforward extension before the February expiration, in a quick deal immediately after a Biden inauguration. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take Trump\u2019s proposal now, it doesn\u2019t mean we lose New START,\u201d Mr. Felgenhauer said.

{"text": "If you enjoyed reading this, subscribe for more! Many observers predicted that the coronavirus pandemic might lead Russian President Vladimir Putin to rethink his highly opportunistic, zero-sum approach to foreign policy. Such assessments turned out to be little more than exercises in wishful thinking. If anything, the Kremlin\u2019s policy toward \u201ccore Europe\u201d\u2014Germany, France, and the United Kingdom\u2014has followed the same aggressive, in-your-face approach, leading to growing awareness that Moscow is not at all serious about lowering the tensions that followed the annexation of Crimea and war in eastern Ukraine. Today, Russia\u2019s relations with core Europe are getting worse. The Kremlin taunts the West over the attempted assassination of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny using a banned military-grade nerve agent. Its suggestions that he was somehow poisoned in Germany, where he was flown for treatment, have pulled the rug out from under longtime advocates of closer cooperation in the economic and energy sphere, including Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel. A controversial attempt by French President Emmanuel Macron to re-engage the Kremlin on a range of strategic and regional issues is also now at risk. The United Kingdom continues to try to push back against Russian malign activities on its territory and to limit undue influence, but a light-touch approach to regulation has made it difficult to achieve major breakthroughs. Why does the Kremlin pursue policies toward Europe that appear so counterproductive on their face? Instead of carefully seeking to exploit long-standing differences within NATO and the European Union about the proper response to Russian aggression against Ukraine or interference in the affairs of European nations, it is Moscow\u2019s own overreach and missteps that time and again encourage greater Western unity, or at the very least leave the allies no alternative to confronting Russia. That pattern, in turn, fosters a dynamic that only makes the Kremlin feel more insecure over the long term. A contributing factor is Moscow\u2019s perennial attempts\u2014unacceptable in twenty-first-century Europe\u2014to treat Germany, France, and the United Kingdom as members of a nineteenth-century-style steering committee of great powers who are entitled somehow to decide the fate of the entire Continent on their own. The Kremlin\u2019s approach to Europe highlights its failure to appreciate the importance of the European project for Berlin and Paris. Russian officials appear to believe their own propaganda that the West has entered a period of irreversible decline and division and all they need to do to succeed as a great power is wait out their many adversaries. The Kremlin\u2019s actions point to a major fault in its strategy toward Europe. Its efforts to deepen and capitalize on what in reality are long-standing differences between the leaders of core Europe and Washington are likely to prove shortsighted and backfire. Germany\u2019s dual track approach of maintaining strong transatlantic security ties with other forms of close engagement with Moscow has been a key feature of its foreign policy since the 1960s. Likewise, Macron is following in the footsteps of previous leaders like former French president Charles de Gaulle in advocating for a new level of dialogue and d\u00e9tente with the Kremlin. But would a more splintered European order, hastened by the corrosive effects of Russia\u2019s policies\u2014without a strong, yet pragmatic, unifying leader like Angela Merkel, who is nearing the end of her tenure\u2014actually be better for Russian interests? During the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic, there were short-lived hopes that the scale of the crisis might prompt a rethink on the part of Russian President Vladimir Putin of his assertive brand of foreign policy. With much of the global economy at a standstill and oil prices in free fall, many observers suggested that he would be forced to shift his attentions to problems closer to home. Surely, cooler heads in the Kremlin would recognize that Russia\u2019s ongoing campaign of mayhem and malign activities in the West\u2014along with more quixotic adventures further afield in parts of the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America\u2014was becoming counterproductive or simply unaffordable. Yet throughout the crisis the Putin regime has never wavered on its core agenda. The threat of a dramatic drop in oil revenues for the Russian state budget was minimized following an emergency agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on production cuts that helped stabilize the oil market. The government\u2019s capable economic team decided once again that it was preferable for average citizens to bear the brunt of the adjustment caused by the crisis rather than dip deeply into the country\u2019s hard-currency reserves, which total nearly $600 billion. Thanks to a weaker ruble, higher government spending, and increased domestic borrowing, the Kremlin has managed to avoid explosive growth in the unemployment rate, to mount a modest public-health response to the pandemic, and to avoid draconian cuts in defense and national security expenditures. The political bill for Putin\u2019s aloof handling of the crisis was also delayed, even though his popularity has experienced significant declines. Even before the virus, policymakers in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom (the site of a Russian-state-sponsored attack using a military-grade nerve agent in 2018) had harbored hopes of lowering the temperature with Russia. For these countries, which will be referred to in this paper as core Europe, the pandemic was initially seen as a potential opportunity to break out of the downward spiral created by the Ukraine crisis in 2014. They have thus been caught off-guard by the sharp deterioration of relations that began in August following the disputed election outcome in Belarus and the attempted assassination of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. This paper seeks to assess why Russian policies and behavior toward core Europe have hardened during the pandemic. Rather than dealing with major challenges at home or building bridges to former partners, the Kremlin has instead pursued policies that prioritize short-term advantage over the prospect of re-normalization. The stances of Germany and France on Russia have been widely criticized in recent years\u2014for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s defense of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline and French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s attempt to launch a strategic dialogue with Putin\u2014but in the end it is largely the Kremlin\u2019s behavior that has aggravated relations. Nonetheless, there is value in forming a judgment about the extent to which current European approaches have conformed to or strayed from long-standing patterns. For example, Germany\u2019s leaders have long pursued a dual-track policy of constraining Russia\u2019s foreign policy ambitions and maintaining a strong stake in transatlantic security ties while trying to foster various types of economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. In a similar vein, there are clear parallels between Macron\u2019s efforts and former president Charles de Gaulle\u2019s outreach to the Soviet leadership at the height of the Cold War. And, while the United Kingdom has witnessed the sharpest deterioration in its relationship with Russia, its political economy creates unusual entr\u00e9e for state-backed and nonstate Russian actors in myriad ways, some of which are potentially quite harmful to its national security. The Kremlin has long preferred to deal with individual European countries rather than the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the European Union (EU). It has treated core Europe very much in the tradition of nineteenth century great-power diplomacy or as the European politburo. This approach is partly utilitarian and partly based on awareness that European leaders see value in maintaining direct lines of communication with Moscow and do not always see eye to eye with Washington. At the same time, the Kremlin has frequently overestimated the quality of the cards it has to play in Europe. Repeated Russian attempts to split NATO or the EU have fallen flat over the past several decades. The staying power of both institutions\u2014and the European unity that undergirds them\u2014has been quite impressive, even in extreme circumstances like the current pandemic, the annexation of Crimea and war in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the Euromissile crisis of the early 1980s. Along the way, Russian leaders have demonstrated a repeated propensity to shoot themselves in the foot. Their overreach has stiffened European resolve and reinforced the central role of Germany, which precisely because of its special relationship with Russia has been crucial in managing the EU\u2019s ties with a truculent neighbor. Moscow has also demonstrated time and again that it simply does not get the importance of the EU for Germany and France, and that lack of understanding frequently backfires for the Kremlin. For their part, U.S. diplomats and military officers have long strived to reconcile the competing priorities and goals of their European allies. As one very experienced NATO hand put it, the leaders of the alliance have generally proved themselves to be masters at balancing conventional and nuclear defense, balancing d\u00e9tente and defense, balancing the process of European integration which de Gaulle wanted with alliance of the Atlantic solidarity, balancing national interests, which are very strong, with the need for a common denominator of collective security. With Russian behavior once again posing a direct threat to NATO members, this balancing act has become increasingly important of late, but the alliance has generally succeeded in restoring a proper level of focus to its original core mission of deterrence and collective defense. The United States has traditionally relied on high-level diplomacy and informal decisionmaking and coordination mechanisms to help shape transatlantic policy toward Russia and to bridge differences with its core European allies. During former U.S. president Gerald Ford\u2019s administration, the Quad was created to facilitate regular dialogue among the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom at the level of foreign ministers and senior diplomats. More recently, this mechanism has played an important role in the response to Russia\u2019s military aggression against Ukraine, including joint U.S./EU economic sanctions, the revitalization of NATO, and steps to improve the resilience of EU and frontline countries to respond to Russian malign activities. There have long been subtle yet significant differences in the approaches pursued by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom toward Russia. For example, on the Ukraine crisis Merkel took the lead within the EU on forging a unified stance with then U.S. president Barack Obama\u2019s administration, using her personal political capital to shape and sustain the sanctions regime while carving out a diplomatic track on the basis of the Minsk accords. At the same time, she has never abandoned close engagement with Russia on energy, trade, and commercial matters, which has frequently ruffled feathers in Washington as well as in Central European capitals. By contrast, the United Kingdom\u2019s policy and rhetoric on Russia have traditionally been much firmer than Germany\u2019s or France\u2019s. In a dramatic speech in November 2017, the UK\u2019s then prime minister Theresa May portrayed the Kremlin as a threat to the international order, citing the war in Ukraine, election meddling, a \u201csustained campaign of cyber espionage and disruption,\u201d and the weaponizing of information. \u201cI have a very simple message for Russia,\u201d May said. \u201cWe know what you are doing. And you will not succeed.\u201d Yet during this contentious period her eventual successor, Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, nurtured hopes for a possible reset in relations. Even today some pockets of the foreign policy establishment remain open to turning the page with Russia. It is hard to imagine such an effort succeeding, however, given how the Novichok attack on former Soviet intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury in March 2018 has transformed the domestic political context. Still, as Duncan Allan, a longtime Foreign and Commonwealth Office Russia specialist, has written, The measures adopted after the Salisbury attack were essentially a sterner version of what was tried in 2007 [following the killing in the United Kingdom of former Russian intelligence officer Aleksandr Litvinenko with radioactive polonium]\u2013 broadly \u2018deterrence by denial\u2019 (making it more difficult to conduct future hostile attacks on UK soil). There was minimal resort to \u2018deterrence by punishment\u2019 (i.e., imposing a cost to discourage future unacceptable activities) beyond symbolic steps such as suspending high-level bilateral contacts and not sending ministers or members of the royal family to the World Cup. A report of the UK parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee published in July 2020\u2014 after a lengthy, politically inspired delay\u2014provides a similarly withering assessment of the government\u2019s handling of the growing Russian threat. It details the absence of adequate responses to an array of hostile activities by Moscow, including suspected meddling in the Brexit referendum, cyber and information operations, and the reported killings of more than a dozen opponents of the Putin regime on British soil. The report also chronicles the struggles of British law enforcement and security authorities to curb Russian influence in the country and prevent inflows of illicit finance. As for France, Macron\u2019s approach, with its unabashed boldness and risk-taking as well as pointed criticism of the past handling of the Kremlin by the country\u2019s \u201cdeep state,\u201d has been the outlier among the core Europe countries. In an August 2019 address delivered on the eve of a summit meeting with Putin, Macron asserted that it was unacceptable for the relationship with Russia to stay frozen. Doing so placed the EU in the middle of a \u201cstrategic battle between the United States and Russia.\u201d Following in the footsteps of de Gaulle, who advocated d\u00e9tente and rapprochement with the Kremlin in the mid-1960s, Macron announced that the time had arrived for a strategic dialogue to build \u201can agenda of trust.\u201d The provocative analysis and strategic thinking outlined in Macron\u2019s address were overshadowed by a conspicuous lack of diplomatic finesse that ignored the deep divisions on Russia that have plagued the EU for years. Presenting such views without advance consultation with key countries like Germany was counterproductive. Macron exacerbated intra-EU tensions by asserting that some frontline EU/NATO countries were happy with the status quo and supported additional sanctions because they were not interested in the situation ever improving. Macron\u2019s critics said he was offering concessions to the Kremlin ahead of any changes in behavior and trying to foreclose the possibility of future EU or NATO membership for countries like Ukraine and Georgia. Undaunted, Macron\u2019s government has pursued a series of high-level interactions with Russia, led by a longtime French career diplomat (and fellow Carnegie Endowment for International Peace scholar), Pierre Vimont, and Putin\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, Yuriy Ushakov. These talks have included exchanges involving foreign and defense ministers, top military commanders, and the intelligence services. The dialogue has covered issues such as arms control and disarmament, regional hot spots, cyber activities and new threats, and the deconfliction of military activities and confidence-building measures. French officials insist that they never expected the relationship would be transformed in short order, but Russian officials have reportedly shown no flexibility in the ongoing discussions. The Kremlin is all too aware that Macron is not in a position to negotiate on behalf of the EU, let alone the United States. As former French ambassador to Russia Jean-Maurice Ripert put it, the Russians need to regain some form of economic and political legitimacy, because their only way of existing for the past ten years has been through military action. But that requires major bilateral negotiations. The Russians do not want to negotiate security in Europe with us, but with the Americans. As of July 2020, Macron\u2019s initiative had not produced any concrete signs of progress, according to Defense Minister Florence Parly. At the same time, trends in public opinion also impose certain constraints on policymaking in the countries of core Europe. On the whole, a lack of trust in Putin and wariness about Russia are easily discernible in public perceptions in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. (See figures 1 and 2.) Yet the level of public concern about the threat posed by Russia is fairly subdued in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Only 33 percent of Germans and 40 percent of French surveyed said Russia was a threat to security in Europe, according to a 2018 poll. By contrast, 50 percent of Germans and 44 percent of French respondents in the same poll said they see the United States as the main threat to European security. In 2017, only 8 percent of German respondents in one poll identified Russia as the country\u2019s greatest foreign policy challenge. In the United Kingdom, 33 percent of respondents in a 2020 poll said they viewed Russian military power as a major threat to national security. As discussed above, the coronavirus pandemic has not triggered significant deviations from the Kremlin\u2019s full-contact, highly opportunistic approach to foreign policy. Rather, the foreign policy apparatus continues to operate in familiar ways on issues close to home and much further afield. This continuity reflects several factors, including the Russian leadership\u2019s well-established view that entertaining, let alone implementing, meaningful policy changes on a given issue will inevitably be perceived as a sign of weakness and an invitation to foreign powers to increase their demands. Over the past fifteen years, the Kremlin has repeatedly demonstrated that it understands three things very well: how to build and exploit leverage, how to create facts on the ground, and how to identify and capitalize on the weaknesses of and vacuums created by Russia\u2019s adversaries. The latest flashpoints in Europe\u2019s relationship with Russia\u2014the crisis in Belarus and the attack on Navalny\u2014illustrate the challenge facing Western leaders. Germany, France, and other European countries have repeatedly tried to help defuse the dangerous standoff in Belarus between Alexander Lukashenko and the protest movement, but they have very little leverage, for example, to insist on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as the main platform for dialogue. Putin has repeatedly waved off such suggestions, signaling instead his willingness to intervene militarily if necessary. In the meantime, the Kremlin has spread disinformation about foreign meddling in Belarus, portraying the protests and Western diplomatic outreach as part of an effort to stage a color revolution. In August Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: I urge all the people saying that mediation is the only way out of the current situation to not forget how our Western colleagues \u2018mediated\u2019 in 2014 during the Maidan in Kiev. Back then, esteemed representatives of the European Union \u2018mediated\u2019 and reached agreements, but we all remember what it turned into. In a similar vein, the Kremlin has dismissed Western concerns about Navalny, who was poisoned on Russian soil and evacuated to Germany for medical treatment. Instead of taking German, French, and Swedish toxicology reports seriously and mounting a credible investigation, Russian officials are sticking to the established playbook from the earlier attack on Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom. Russian officials and proxies engage in over-the-top denialism and disinformation about the use of Novichok in the attack, demanding that Western counterparts share any hard evidence of traces of this banned substance and spreading endless numbers of alternative theories and explanations to muddy the waters. Senior figures such as Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Director Sergey Naryshkin and Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin have made preposterous claims that Western intelligence agencies may have staged the attack as a provocation. What emerges from recent interviews with senior European diplomats is the unmistakable sense that dialogue with Moscow remains almost completely nonproductive and that discussions on the most important issues on the European-Russian agenda have all been moving in the wrong direction. The Normandy process on ending the war in Ukraine has been slowly unraveling following the January 2020 appointment of a new Russian representative, Dmitri Kozak. His antics have largely paralyzed that process, upending initial expectations that he might emerge as a more constructive interlocutor than his predecessor, former Kremlin political guru Vladislav Surkov. Ongoing attempts to engage the Kremlin about the corrosive impact on relations with core Europe of malign activities such as cyber operations, targeted killings, and the deployment of Russian mercenaries in Libya and other regional conflicts have been met by flat denials, stonewalling and pro forma, tit-for-tat counteraccusations. For Germany, other salient issues on the bilateral agenda include the 2015 hacking of the Bundestag (discussed below) and the 2019 murder of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a critic of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and former militant, in broad daylight in central Berlin. When Foreign Minister Heiko Maas visited Moscow in August 2020, he made no headway on either issue. In recent years the United Kingdom has led coordinated efforts to expose Russian cyber activities. UK authorities formally attributed to Russia cyber operations targeting Ukraine, Georgia, and research institutions involved in coronavirus vaccine development in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. (The Russian government has disavowed any responsibility. ) While the United Kingdom\u2019s public moves have presumably been accompanied by other undisclosed activities to raise the costs of Russian behavior, there is as yet no indication that formal attribution of attacks involving Russian-government-sponsored hackers APT28 (the group also known as Fancy Bear, which has been linked to Russia\u2019s military intelligence service, the GRU ) and APT29 (the SVR-linked group also known as Cozy Bear ) is producing changes in Russian behavior. More recently the UK government has publicized Russian interference in the December 2019 general election via a hack-and-release effort involving sensitive U.S.-UK trade documents reportedly stolen from the personal email account of then trade minister Liam Fox. According to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, the documents were \u201cdisseminated online via the social media platform Reddit. When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the General Election.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, then leader of the UK Labor Party, sought to capitalize on the documents in the final weeks of the election campaign. \u201cThis is not only a plot against our NHS [National Health Service],\u201d said Corbyn in late November 2019. \u201cIt is a plot against the whole country.\u201d It has not been alleged that Corbyn was aware of the source of the documents. Russia\u2019s recent track record leaves an inescapable impression that the Kremlin is profoundly uninterested in forging any improvement in relations with core Europe. Instead, Russian policy is following well-established priorities that have been such a constant in recent years as to almost seem immutable. These are: At the same time, the Kremlin\u2019s approach to core Europe appears to be relying on a latter day equivalent of the Roman-era Fabian strategy of fighting a war of attrition rather than frontal assault. Put simply, the Putin regime hopes to prevail in a test of wills with Europe (and, by extension, the United States) just by not losing and outlasting its many adversaries. Moreover, Russian officials often act in high-handed ways that suggest they actually believe the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda that says the Western camp is in inexorable decline and that many of its cherished values and ideas are discredited or have been disowned by public opinion. Such attitudes help explain why there has been so much opportunism and continuity in Russian behavior throughout the coronavirus pandemic. In March, a leaked EU report highlighted an ongoing Russian disinformation campaign intended \u201cto aggravate the public health crisis in western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems \u2014 thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak.\u201d Within days, the Russian military launched a series of aid deliveries and troop deployments to northern Italy, Serbia, and Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The deliveries aimed to discredit the EU\u2019s accusations and to shine a spotlight on a string of embarrassing everyone-for-himself policy failures by EU member states. Macron and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell responded frostily to the Kremlin\u2019s moves, with the latter decrying a \u201cstruggle for influence through spinning and the \u2018politics of generosity\u2019.\u201d The launch of the Sputnik-V vaccine in August 2020 (in advance of clinical trials) has confirmed Moscow\u2019s continued preference for public-relations stunts that play on raw emotions instead of practical contributions to fighting the pandemic. The combined effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Belarus crisis, and the Navalny attack have upended Germany\u2019s political landscape in ways that are bound to limit Russian influence. Merkel\u2019s personal popularity has soared to all-time highs while the fortunes of populist political parties like the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) have ebbed significantly. Although the AfD and Die Linke (the Left) remain resolutely pro-Russian voices in the political debate, they have had practically zero impact on policymaking before and during the pandemic. The May 2020 indictment in absentia of the GRU hacker responsible for the 2015 Bundestag attack and the upcoming trial of the suspected assassin of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili provide vivid illustrations of how Russian malign activities are touching closer to the heart of German politics and society. The government has tried to handle both cases carefully to limit the impact on other parts of the relationship with Moscow and to allow the legal process to play out.That balancing act has become more difficult as details about ties between Khangoshvili\u2019s alleged killer, Vadim Krasikov, and the Russian state have become clearer. According to the indictment, \u201cState agencies of the central government of the Russian Federation commissioned the defendant to liquidate the Georgian citizen of Chechen origin.\u201d The fact that Putin expressed his delight at Khangoshvili\u2019s murder has not made the German government\u2019s life easier. With the trial likely to bring new details to light, the government will face greater pressure to go beyond the largely symbolic expulsion of two intelligence officers from the Russian embassy in Berlin in December 2019. In the meantime, the case of Dmitri Badin, the GRU hacker held responsible for the Bundestag hack, has slowly wound its way through the German legal system. (Badin was previously indicted by U.S. law-enforcement authorities for his role in attacks on the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and the World Anti-Doping Agency in 2014\u20132018.) Following his indictment, Berlin orchestrated the first-ever use of a new EU sanctions mechanism targeting individuals and institutions involved in cyber attacks. During his August 2020 Moscow visit, Maas portrayed the sanctions as \u201ca first shot across the bows of those who believe they can inflict damage in cyberspace with impunity.\u201d In response, Lavrov issued flimsy counterclaims about the purported failure of German authorities to address official complaints about cyber intrusions against Russian government institutions from Germany-based IP addresses. Moscow is also likely on the losing end of a possible generational realignment of Russia policy in conjunction with Merkel\u2019s expected departure and the general election in the autumn of 2021. That prospect is already causing disquiet in Russian government circles, reflecting the Kremlin\u2019s traditional aversion to the uncertainty of Western leadership transitions and preference for dealing with known quantities. Current trends suggest the emergence of a new governing coalition consisting of the Christian Democrats and the Greens, who have regularly staked out a far tougher line on Russia than Merkel\u2019s current coalition partners, the Social Democrats. Green Party co-leader Annalena Baerbock has laid the blame directly on the Kremlin for the Navalny poisoning and called for an end to business as usual with Russia, the cancelation of Nord Stream 2, and the imposition of sanctions and asset freezes against top Russian business figures active in Germany. The leadership of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) continues to be riven by an unresolved debate about how best to balance the traditional German focus on trade and commercial cooperation with the need to show Russia that its unacceptable behavior has consequences. That split is visible in the conflicting positions staked out by the top contenders to succeed Merkel. Bavarian premier Markus S\u00f6der (who leads the CDU\u2019s sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union) and North Rhine-Westphalia premier Armin Laschet have aligned themselves with Merkel\u2019s position that the project is a purely private-sector initiative that should be decoupled from foreign policy issues like the Navalny attack. Veteran Christian Democrats Friedrich Merz and Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Norbert R\u00f6ttgen\u2014both, along with Laschet, candidates to succeed Merkel as party chief in December\u2014have called for it to be frozen. Advocates of business interests and proponents of the traditional formula of \u201cchange by rapprochement\u201d ( ) have been increasingly on the defensive. Their hand has been weakened by the fact that Russian-German trade appears to have peaked following the imposition of EU sanctions in 2014; turnover in 2019 was \u20ac54.5 billion, down by roughly 30 percent since 2012. More recently, bilateral trade fell by nearly 25 percent during the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. In the second quarter of 2020, new German foreign direct investment in Russia hit its lowest level since 2000. Strong countervailing pressure comes from Germany\u2019s energy policy, which is being transformed by a combination of ambitious climate targets and shifting domestic priorities yet also risks tying the country much closer to Russia. Ahead of a planned phasing out of nuclear power by the end of 2022 and of coal by 2038, Germany is seeking to ramp up very quickly the role of renewables in electricity generation and to become an important hub for the trade and distribution of natural gas. However, the country is almost completely dependent on foreign sources of natural gas, which now account for 93 percent of supply. The share of Russian gas in Germany\u2019s imports has increased significantly in recent years and now stands at 57 percent. That growth, which is partially a by-product of the planned phasing out of the Groningen field in the Netherlands by the end of 2022, is in marked contrast to the overall trend throughout the EU. Russia accounted for only 38.3 percent of the EU\u2019s natural gas imports in 2018. Critics worry that completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline could lock in this structural dependence for years if not decades to come. At the same time, a global natural-gas supply glut and volatile European prices make it difficult to have high confidence about future German gas consumption levels. There is also growing concern among German law enforcement and national security officials about the increased popularity of homegrown fringe political figures who spread disinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic. Russia is contributing in non-negligible ways to this phenomenon, which benefits from savvy use of online platforms such as YouTube and Telegram. Leading grassroots figures involved in the protests against pandemic health-related restrictions receive frequent attention from Russian-state-controlled media outlets such as RT Deutsch and Sputnik Deutschland as well as Russia-aligned anti-establishment media outlets such as Security officials, including the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency (BfV), have also warned repeatedly that right-wing extremists and neo-Nazi groups are seeking to commandeer the protest movement for their own purposes. Members of some of these extremist groups have received military training in Russia, including at a facility run by the Russian Imperial Movement, which was designated a global terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in April 2020. The rapid growth of conspiracy-theory groups benefits from loopholes in legislation and regulations aimed at preventing hate speech and political extremism. As already shown in the notorious \u201cLisa\u201d case in 2016 during the height of the migration crisis, Russia-tied actors are highly opportunistic, operating mainly in plain sight of the authorities. Macron has frequently turned himself into a lightning rod thanks to his knack for provocative statements, such as proclaiming the brain death of NATO, that challenge or criticize policy orthodoxy. His stance on Russia has generally followed this pattern. Macron\u2019s initiative to launch a strategic dialogue with Putin was partially borne of frustration with what he perceived as policy gridlock within EU institutions. In early 2016 EU leaders agreed on five guiding principles that called for full implementation of the Minsk agreements as a prerequisite for any improvement in relations, stronger ties to Russia\u2019s neighbors, stronger EU internal resilience in areas such as energy security and hybrid threats, selective engagement with Russia on major policy issues where there is a clear EU interest, and increased support for Russian civil society and people-to-people contacts. In his August 2019 speech, Macron essentially argued that the divisions within the EU were rendering institutions such as the European External Access Service far less effective even as Russia has remained extremely active in various parts of the world, often at Europe\u2019s expense. [Russia] has gained room for maneuver thanks to our weaknesses. In the past five years, Russia has played an unprecedented role in every major conflict; it has played an unprecedented role because the United States of America, Britain and France have been weak. We set red lines, they were crossed and we did not take action. They understood this very well, they advanced. . . . In the current situation, Russia has maximized all its interests: it has returned to Syria, it has returned to Libya, it has returned to Africa, it is present in every crisis because of our weaknesses or mistakes. Macron\u2019s attempt to forge a new strategic dialogue with Russia is quite similar to the approaches pursued by his predecessors. It also is informed by the outlook of conservative French political elites, who have never been shy about their anti-Americanism, desire for autonomy from transatlantic structures, and generally friendly attitude toward Moscow. Macron\u2019s advisers also emphasize that Western policies have not produced a change in Russian behavior and that the status quo is unacceptable. In the words of former foreign minister Hubert V\u00e9drine, who serves as an informal sounding board for Macron, It\u2019s not about loving the Russian regime or Putin, or stopping our calls for the Russians to become more \u2018democratic,\u2019 but to know what kind of relations we want to have with this great neighboring country, and if it is up to the United States alone to redefine this relationship. Meanwhile, the existence of multiple pathways for Russian influence in French political and corporate circles tends not to set off alarm bells in Paris. Issues such as terrorism, China, and the challenging relationship with the United States are widely seen as France\u2019s most pressing foreign policy priorities, which means in practice that Russia simply does not preoccupy French leaders or the political class the way it does those in Berlin, London, or Washington. However, while Macron and other senior members of his team have on occasion made skeptical noises about EU sanctions against Russia, they have not tried to block their regular renewal out of deference to Merkel. French-Russian trade ties have been largely stagnant for the past several years and are only one-fourth the size of the bilateral trade relationship between Russia and Germany. The trade and commercial relationship was fairly limited even before the coronavirus pandemic due to Russia\u2019s extended economic doldrums and the ruble devaluation that accompanied a sharp decline in energy prices in 2014. Since 2010, total trade turnover has declined by nearly one-third, and it was roughly \u20ac13.8 billion in 2019. Russia was France\u2019s eleventh-largest trading partner in 2018; by comparison, trade volume with China was more than four times greater. Russia\u2019s involvement in French politics has remained fairly subdued throughout the pandemic. Russian-sponsored disinformation and propaganda efforts aimed at the French public have been limited. That stands in marked contrast to the huge political outcry caused by a false posting about the French government\u2019s handling of the pandemic that appeared on the website of the Chinese embassy. During earlier periods Russia\u2019s political leaders, state propaganda apparatus, and proxies have left much more conspicuous fingerprints. For example, in 2017 a murky alliance of Russia-based hackers and U.S. alt-right activist hackers interfered in the presidential election by releasing emails stolen from Macron\u2019s campaign on the eve of the second round of voting. Russian state-controlled media also spread rumors in an attempt to damage Macron\u2019s candidacy. And in 2018\u20132019 Russia-connected media outlets frequently amplified the disruptive protests of the Yellow Vests movement. The Russian government has long-standing ties to French far-right politicians. Six weeks before the 2017 election, Putin met in the Kremlin with Marine Le Pen, Macron\u2019s challenger and longtime leader of the National Rally (formerly National Front.) The cash-strapped party also received a \u20ac9.4 million loan from a shadowy Russian bank in 2014. More recently, the National Rally has continued with its well-established cheerleading for the Kremlin\u2019s actions. For example, a large delegation of its members in the European Parliament visited Moscow and Crimea in July 2020 to observe the referendum on extending Putin\u2019s time in office. (Far-right politicians from Germany, Italy, and other countries made similar pilgrimages. At Macron\u2019s first meeting with Putin in 2017, he chided the Russian leader over the Kremlin\u2019s blatant interference in the election. \u201cThe situation was so serious because during the democratic campaign some so-called media outlets interfered, acting under the influence of certain political interests,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIn other words, Russia Today and Sputnik did not behave as the press or as journalists should. They behaved like bodies of influence, bodies of propaganda, that is, bodies of false propaganda, no more and no less.\u201d Macron has pressed for a credible Russian investigation of the assassination attempt on Navalny, aligning himself closely with Germany and postponing the next round of so-called two-plus-two talks between the French and Russian ministers of foreign affairs and defense. The Kremlin\u2019s allies in the National Rally have prioritized trying to shield Moscow from foreign pressure, warning against any rush to judgment. For example, Thierry Mariani, a member of the European Parliament and former minister, tweeted \u201cWho can prove the Russian government\u2019s involvement in the poisoning of #Navalny? No one! Stop accusations without proof! Those nostalgic for the East/West confrontation are ready to exploit all the dramas to a new cold war.\u201d One area where France\u2019s preoccupation with counterterrorism has aligned with Russian interests is in Libya. Since the mid-2010s, the two countries have been de facto allies, thanks to their clandestine support of General Khalifa Haftar, the leader of the Libyan National Army, though both have also engaged with and supported the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), which Haftar opposes. Along with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, France and Russia have supplied Haftar\u2019s forces with weapons, military advisers, and other material in violation of a United Nations (UN) arms embargo. While providing lip service and formal recognition to the GNA, France has justified its actions as part of the fight against terrorist and criminal groups operating in Libya and Chad, though an undercurrent of ideological affinity, including anti-Islamism and a pro-strongman bent that is evident in France\u2019s broader Africa policies, also cements this partnership. At the same time, increased Russian adventurism in Africa is generating considerable irritation and mistrust in Paris. In 2017\u20132018 France\u2019s leadership was blindsided by what it described as \u201cpredatory\u201d Kremlin maneuvers in the region, including anti-French information operations and the deployment of mercenaries from the Wagner Group to the Central African Republic, a former French colony. Since then Russia has effectively replaced France as the country\u2019s chief security partner. The French government sees the Central African Republic as an important test case of the Kremlin\u2019s intentions. In the words of Chief of the Defense Staff General Francois Lecointre, the country is a \u201claboratory to test the goodwill proclaimed by Russia to be a partner in the resolution of crises, and not [a power] that wants to use these crises for the purposes of destabilization.\u201d While the intensity of anti-French influence operations in the Central African Republic has declined somewhat in recent months, the Kremlin is increasingly stoking anti-French sentiment in West Africa, which is generating considerable high-level concern. The fight against terrorism in the Sahel has been a priority area in recent years for Paris, which has dispatched some 5,100 troops to the region. Macron has complained publicly that foreign powers are trying to push European countries out of the region \u201cbecause they have their own agenda, an agenda of mercenaries.\u201d Russia has sold modest amounts of military equipment and provided limited opportunities for joint military training across the region in recent years, but it has not created a large-scale footprint there. Nor are there concrete indications that the Kremlin is actively trying to supplant France\u2019s leadership of the multinational anti-terrorism mission in the Sahel. Rather, it appears that stoking instability and causing trouble for France are simply ends in themselves. The Kremlin\u2019s preferred means in the Sahel include old-fashioned cultivation of regional officials and low-cost tools such as inauthentic social-media campaigns. Materials created by the Russian Internet Research Agency that Facebook took down in August 2020 included an example of a Mali-related, anti-French posting in Arabic (see figure 3). Traces of pro-Russia influence operations, disinformation, and propaganda about the security situation in the region are relatively easy to find on social media. For example, social-media posts disseminated images of the Russian flag and pro-Putin signs that featured prominently in celebrations in Bamako following the military coup in August 2020. Facebook posts at the time also spread fake claims that Russian troops had landed in Mali in the aftermath of the coup (see figure 4). Meanwhile, a group calling itself the \u201cGroupe des Patriotes du Mali\u201d posts a steady stream of harsh anti-French and pro-Russian materials on Facebook (see figure 5). To be sure, France\u2019s operations in the Sahel face considerable challenges that have little to do with any problems generated by Russia. These include mounting public anger over civilian casualties, governance and partner capacity shortcomings, and the possible scaling back of U.S. contributions such as strategic airlift and intelligence support. At the same time, it is clear that Russian mischief in the region is not a peripheral concern for Paris, which has seized on it as one of the criteria for whether it can restore trust to the bilateral relationship. Whether or not they are part of a well-coordinated and strategic approach, Moscow\u2019s actions in the Sahel are having a corrosive effect on relations with the Macron government. Pathways for Russian influence in the United Kingdom have become an increasingly prominent topic in recent years. Although it is widely assumed that relations were spoiled by the war in Ukraine and the Skripal attack, the roots of the current antagonism go deeper. Former prime minister Tony Blair was the first prominent Western leader to court Putin during his early years in power. The culminating moment came in 2003 when Blair and Putin personally oversaw the launch of a major energy joint venture, TNK-BP. The result of an arranged marriage between a Western oil major and a top Russian company, TNK-BP was hailed as the largest single foreign direct investment in the Russian economy at the time. Yet the burgeoning relationship was disrupted months later when British courts granted political asylum to Boris Berezovsky, a political nemesis of Putin\u2019s, and to a prominent Chechen separatist. Putin regarded these decisions as an act of personal betrayal, and his relationships with UK counterparts never recovered. Russian officials have long made clear in private that the Kremlin does not view the United Kingdom as a great power but as a country that largely implements the will of the United States. Yet events in recent years have shown that the United Kingdom is, in fact, capable of exerting significant influence over the policies of its allies and partners. In the most widely publicized example, creative UK diplomacy after the Skripal attack led to the coordinated expulsions of dozens of Russian intelligence personnel from more than twenty countries. UK law enforcement, intelligence and strategic communications officials also worked aggressively to turn the tables on the GRU, exposing it to outright ridicule for the botched attack. The United Kingdom\u2019s considerable capabilities in the cyber domain have been marshaled for similar purposes in the hope of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to operate with impunity. UK specialists have also worked behind the scenes to strengthen the resilience of frontline countries and others in Russia\u2019s neighborhood, helping them to combat disinformation and other types of malign activities. At the same time, the UK authorities have made little headway in constraining Russian malign activities conducted inside the country, let alone establishing a proper level of oversight of the extensive Russian presence there. For decades, the Russian elite has had nearly wide-open access to the UK\u2019s economy and to key players in elite political and business circles. Prominent members of the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have been widely criticized for their chummy relationships with prominent well-to-do Russians, many of whom have connections to the Russian government. These ties run the gamut from glamorous social connections to more problematic activities such as political fund-raising and lucrative business relationships. The ISC report states: \u201cIt is notable that a number of Members of the House of Lords have business interests linked to Russia, or work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state.\u201d As discussed above, the extensive presence of wealthy Russian business figures and corporate interests throughout the United Kingdom is a feature, not a bug, of the country\u2019s light-touch regulatory framework. The British leadership has long actively sought to promote the United Kingdom as a global financial and business center yet failed to anticipate the harmful second-order effects on the country\u2019s governance, sovereignty, and national security. For more than a quarter-century, the government has put out a welcome mat for Russian and other wealthy foreign nationals, providing preferential access to visas in return for relatively small investments of 2 million pounds. Today Russian money and corporate interests are a major factor across the breadth of the British business world, the energy sector, the financial services industry, and the high-end real estate market. This presence also helps support an industry of so-called enablers who provide legal, consulting, accountancy, security, and other services to Russian high-net-worth individuals, families, and corporations. Despite the imposition of blocking sanctions on high-level Kremlin-tied figures in 2014\u20132015, there are indications Putin associates like Arkadiy Rotenberg have managed to move significant amounts of money through UK-based financial institutions. As documented in the 2020 report by the parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), officials have often talked big about creating arsenals of legal, diplomatic, and law-enforcement tools to make the United Kingdom a less hospitable jurisdiction for unsavory or illicit Russian interests. Such tools were rolled out with great fanfare after the Skripal attack. Yet the United Kingdom has struggled, for example, to launch a public registry of beneficial-ownership information that would provide transparency about who actually stands behind a vast array of foreign-owned real estate and corporate vehicles. Another much-touted measure, unexplained wealth orders, has been far less useful than UK officials originally suggested. They were devised to allow UK law enforcement to investigate how \u2018politically exposed persons\u2019 suspected of involvement in foreign corruption, as well as suspected criminals, have acquired significant real estate interests and assets that are disproportionate to their lawful incomes. Targets of unexplained wealth orders are required to prove the circumstances surrounding ownership of such property and assets, which can be seized by the authorities under a court order. Unfortunately, several of the early targets have mounted successful challenges in the UK courts, diminishing the value of the new tool. More recently, the National Crime Agency has relied more heavily on a different tool known as account freeze and forfeiture orders, which can be secured in lower courts without having to prove criminal wrongdoing. The government also has occasionally used visa policy to send messages to prominent Russian business figures, such as Roman Abramovich, who had long been accustomed to using the country as a base outside Russia. Still, the outsized lobbying power of the UK financial, real estate, and corporate sectors has made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to overhaul the existing regulatory framework or to make the United Kingdom a less welcoming jurisdiction for Russian petro-dollars and illicit funds. The ISC report also draws attention to the weakness of the UK legal framework for responding to national security threats posed by Russia and other hostile foreign powers. It quotes then MI5 director general Andrew Parker, who said that the Official Secrets Act is \u201cdusty and largely ineffective\u201d because \u201cit was drafted for First World War days and was about sketches of naval dockyards, etc.\u201d The law\u2019s shortcomings are particularly acute in light of the extensive Russian presence that moves freely in and out of the United Kingdom: \u201cUnder the Official Secrets Act as it exists now, anyone who is not a British national or a public servant does not commit an offence if they engage in espionage against the UK while abroad.\u201d The ISC report also recommends that the United Kingdom develop a legal mechanism for disclosure by individuals acting on behalf of a foreign power modeled on the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act, which would be a positive step but hardly a decisive one. Meanwhile, Brexit is having a significant impact on how the United Kingdom operates on the global stage even as it further aggravates internal political divisions. For decades, the country grew accustomed to leveraging its role within the EU as a means to institutionalize its policy ideas and priorities globally via a powerful multilateral mechanism. The United Kingdom\u2019s impact is now being inexorably reduced as result of leaving the EU. The trusting relationship with key partners like Germany and France is also being severely tested by the increasingly acrimonious negotiations over the post-Brexit relationship with the EU. Societal fault lines exposed by Brexit, such as the possibility of a renewed push for Scottish independence, are also likely to prove quite harmful. For its part, the Kremlin typically relishes watching longtime adversaries experience such turmoil. It is hard to imagine that Moscow will not use some of the tools at its disposal, including information and influence operations, to amplify the United Kingdom\u2019s current misfortunes. It remains to be seen whether the Kremlin will go to great lengths to achieve its goals or simply decide to let the United Kingdom stew in its own juices. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Russia\u2019s policy toward core Europe has appeared to be stuck on autopilot. Instead of nimbly trying to exploit Europe\u2019s obvious internal divisions and ongoing tensions with the United States, the Kremlin has simply followed time-worn patterns, acting as though its most important goals could be accomplished simply by sticking to its guns and waiting for Europe to fall apart under the weight of the pandemic and other burdens. Yet this approach is not at all mindful of the galvanizing effect that the protests in Belarus and the attempted assassination of a major opposition political figure is having on German, French, and UK policy. Just as it was blindsided by the extent of Western unity in the wake of the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin today seems oblivious\u2014or simply indifferent\u2014to what its actions will mean for relations with core Europe. Nonetheless there is still considerable concern in some quarters in Berlin, Paris, and London that the Russian government may yet be able to capitalize on an approach that emphasizes strategic patience. After all, the Kremlin is betting, not unreasonably, that one of these days, the West will simply downgrade its long list of irritants and unresolvable disputes with Russia as it has in the past. In the meantime, the Putin regime is trying to intimidate European leaders, playing on perennial fears that things might get out of hand. The Kremlin also wants to convince Western counterparts that they have very little leverage over Russian behavior and to exacerbate the divisions that it believes can keep NATO and the EU bogged down in internal debates and disagreements. What is missing from the Kremlin\u2019s analysis of the current state of affairs is much self-awareness about how its recent behavior is potentially creating an epochal moment comparable to the events of 2014 in Ukraine. The Navalny attack and the crisis in Belarus have stripped away, practically overnight, the credibility of voices in Europe that traditionally advocate on behalf of preserving the status quo. In Germany, for example, the greatest pressure will not be faced by increasingly marginal constituencies like the but rather by Christian Democrat stalwarts like Merkel and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier who call for finding ways to continue cooperation with Russia. Following the Navalny attack the percentage of Germans polled who want to tighten sanctions on Russia more than doubled to 34 percent compared with June 2019, according to a survey conducted in September 2020. It is increasingly unclear whether arguments in favor of the status quo will hold sway as the end of the Merkel era and the general elections draw nearer. In France, these events are greatly complicating Macron\u2019s strategic dialogue with the Kremlin. It is hard to see how French officials can successfully argue within the Quad or in Brussels in favor of a more lenient approach on Russian matters at a time when Moscow\u2019s heavy-handed handling of the Navalny attack and the Belarus crisis generates such intense anger and frustration. In the meantime, Macron is gearing up for reelection in 2022 and appears to hope that he will once again face Le Pen, who has extremely limited ability to appeal to centrists or left-of-center voters. Still, if the impact of the pandemic continues to hang over French society and the economy, it is conceivable that Moscow will once again seek to play on societal divisions and amplify populist voices. At best, Russia\u2019s relations with Germany, France, and the United Kingdom will stay as they are now regardless of whether or not large-scale projects like Nord Stream 2 are frozen. In the same vein, Merkel\u2019s long-standing approach of balancing a tough-minded approach with various types of economic and energy cooperation is becoming more contested. In the run-up to next autumn\u2019s German elections, the stage is potentially being set for an approach toward Russia that prioritizes hard security, treats the Kremlin as an irredeemably dangerous and kleptocratic regime, and supports the imposition of ever greater economic and political costs for Russian misdeeds. At the same time, it is unlikely that mainstream political leaders from Germany, France, or the United Kingdom will be all that interested in resetting ties or that Moscow will succeed in pushing the EU\u2019s post-2014 framework to the breaking point. Still, Europe\u2019s leading powers remain challenged by their inability to mobilize the kind of hard power that matters most in today\u2019s world, especially for building leverage with Russia. It often appears that the leaders of Europe have forgotten how to play the game of power politics. As they find themselves being sucked once again into an era of so-called great-power competition, the Kremlin\u2019s modus operandi in foreign policy is likely to provide significant advantages. Against this backdrop, it is questionable that the biggest challenge for the transatlantic relationship is to hold another arid debate between the United States and its European allies on whether it is necessary to push back on a more assertive Russia. As Macron frequently likes to point out European leaders are not na\u00efve. They have a very solid grasp of whom they are dealing with in the Kremlin. Rather the real question for Western policymakers is how best to devise a proportionate and sustainable response to the threat posed by Russia and to manage ongoing tensions skillfully while preserving the unity of purpose that has served previous generations of Western leaders so well. is the James Family Chair and a vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he oversees research in Washington and Moscow on Russia and Eurasia.

{"text": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 Russia\u2019s foreign minister called for collective efforts Tuesday to prevent a large-scale war in the Persian Gulf and got strong support from all Security Council members except the United States, which called Iran the major culprit and urged that it be held accountable for supporting terrorists and destabilizing the region. Sergey Lavrov told a high-level virtual council meeting that a worst case scenario was avoided earlier this year following the U.S. killing of Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Soleimani, and warned that \u201cthe situation remains fragile and could become dangerous and unpredictable again.\u201d But Russia, which holds the council presidency this month, believes that \u201cif we work together openly and impartially, and if we pool our political will and our creative potential, we will be able to help the states of the Persian Gulf overcome this difficult historic period and create an effective system of collective security,\u201d he said. Robert Malley, president of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, warned that \u201cthe regionwide conflict that now looms largest across the globe is a conflict nobody apparently wants -- a conflict triggered by tensions in the Gulf region.\u201d \u201cIt is far from inevitable,\u201d he said, but \u201ca single attack by rocket, drone or limpet mine could set off a military escalation between the U.S. and Iran and their respective regional allies and proxies that could prove impossible to contain.\u201d \u201cAn inclusive, collective regional security dialogue aimed at lessening tensions may have only a small chance of materializing, and an even smaller chance of success, but under current circumstances it would be irresponsible not to give it a try,\u201d Malley said. There was no shortage of ideas on promoting collective security from council members. U.S. allies Britain, France and Germany all supported confidence building measures in the Gulf and stressed their support for the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of in 2018 \u2014 but they also sharply criticized Iran for destabilizing activities. Two days after the lifting of the U.N. arms embargo on Iran over U.S. objections, French Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere urged possible weapons suppliers and recipients \u201cto exercise the utmost restraint and responsibility in considering the consequences that possible transfers could have for regional security and stability, and to draw the necessary conclusions.\u201d Britain\u2019s acting ambassador, Jonathan Allen, said Iran has continued to transfer arms to regional groups and told the council the UK would work \u201cto find a suitable solution to Iranian proliferation.\u201d German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen criticized human rights violations in Iran, where, he said, \u201ccivilian and political rights are violated every day,\u201d prisons \u201care the most abhorrent in the whole region,\u201d and \u201creligious minorities like the Baha\u2019i are persecuted.\u201d U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft, meanwhile, dismissed any idea of collective security for the Gulf, touting instead the Trump administration\u2019s new approach to the Middle East, including its key role in promoting diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Responding to Russia\u2019s promotion of security for the Persian Gulf, Craft said: \u201cRespectfully, I think the solution is much easier: This council must simply muster the courage to hold Iran accountable to its existing international obligations.\u201d \u201cThe United States recognizes that Iran is the single greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East,\u201d she said. She pointed to Iran\u2019s development of ballistic missiles and support for proxies in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, saying that \u201cthe United States will continue to hold Iran accountable, even if it means we must act alone.\u201d \u201cWhat makes America special is that we are unafraid to stand up for what is right,\u201d Craft said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need a cheering section to validate my moral compass.\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the U.S. deployment of nearly 50,000 troops in the Persian Gulf in 29 military installations, with more than 300 combat aircraft, and its hundreds of billions of dollars of arms sales \u201chave enhanced neither the security of the external powers, nor of the region.\u201d \u201cWe need collective efforts by regional countries to establish inclusive dialogue and security networking in this region,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, we will all be engulfed in turmoil for generations to come.\u201d Zarif said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s proposal for a Hormuz peace and security initiative launched a year ago awaits a response from regional leaders. Lavrov reiterated Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s initiative to hold an online meeting of leaders of the five permanent Security Council members \u2014 the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France \u2014 along with Germany to discuss ways to bring peace to the region. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the first step toward de-escalation is identifying viable confidence-building measures such as ways to combat the coronavirus, promote economic recovery, ensure unhindered maritime navigation and arrange religious pilgrimages.

{"text": "President Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit in 2017 in Hamburg, Germany. President Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit in 2017 in Hamburg, Germany. Early this month, President Trump's national security adviser Robert O'Brien held with his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev. The two men met in neutral Switzerland as Patrushev, a confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is under sanctions by \"One of the reasons I went to meet with Gen. Patrushev is to let him know that there would be absolutely no tolerance for any interference with our Election Day,\" . He said he \"demanded that Russia not engage in that sort of thing. The Russians have committed to doing so.\" Despite Patrushev's commitment and O'Brien's apparent acceptance of it, U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia is still trying to interfere. Last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray before Congress that Russia is engaging in \"malign foreign influence\" \u2014 including the use of social media and propaganda \u2014 that primarily goes after Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. Vice President Joe Biden shakes hands with Vladimir Putin, then Russia's prime minister, in Moscow in 2011. Vice President Joe Biden shakes hands with Vladimir Putin, then Russia's prime minister, in Moscow in 2011. The Kremlin has categorically denied interfering in any U.S. elections, past or present. But the Kremlin also recognizes that the issue has become an obstacle to improving bilateral relations, even slightly. A little more than a week after Wray's testimony, an agreement that would ban interference in the other country's electoral processes. The initiative echoed Putin's proposal to form which he floated during his 2018 summit with Trump in Finland \u2014 and went nowhere. The Kremlin is sticking to the line that it is in fact the United States that tries to interfere in Russian politics. Three years ago, the Federation Council, the upper house of the parliament, formed a temporary commission on foreign interference in Russia. \"It's called 'temporary' because we hope that the time will come when you won't interfere with us,\" Andrei Klimov, the commission's chairman, tells NPR. \"If we make the commission permanent, it would mean you're going to constantly interfere with us. We still want to believe in the good.\" Klimov says his commission has accumulated thousands of pages of documentation of U.S. influence efforts. He claims American foundations connected to the U.S. government work with Russian political activists, and that cyberattacks on Russia originating in the United States are manyfold those in the other direction. The notion of \"Russian interference\" was a bogeyman, he says, invented during the Obama administration to try to help Hillary Clinton win the White House in 2016. In Moscow, the acrimony left over from the last U.S. presidential election is real. Everything was supposed to be so different when Donald Trump unexpectedly took over the presidency from Barack Obama, promising to improve relations with Russia. What followed instead were continuing charges of Russian malfeasance by Trump's own intelligence officials \u2014 and bipartisan support in Congress for tightening sanctions. Now, with about three months left in Trump's term, U.S.-Russian relations are even more fraught than when he came into office. The last major arms control treaty between the United States and Russia will expire in February, and negotiations continue to extend it. , a barometer of the Kremlin's mood, anchor Dmitry Kiselyov used the first presidential debate to criticize America as a whole. Anyone who watched the contentious debate was left with a \"feeling of disgust,\" Kiselyov said. \"For decades, America has imposed its way of life on the world as a universal model,\" he said. \"And now everything has changed so fast.\" Trump, once celebrated as a friend of Russia, is no longer seen so favorably. According to , only 23% of Russians have a positive view of Trump, while 43% have a negative one. And 55% of respondents said they were hearing about Biden for the very first time. The Kremlin, of course, knows Biden very well. \"I think the very fact that Biden was Obama's vice president already makes him not a friendly figure in Russia,\" says Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman. \"Obama looked down on Russia. In some of his statements, he certainly sounded not respectful. This caused this sense of offense on Russia's part.\" Even as the Obama administration pursued a \"reset\" in relations with the Kremlin, Biden made , saying in 2009 that it had \"a withering economy\" and was \"clinging to something in the past that was not sustainable.\" On a visit to Moscow in 2011, \u2014 the Russian president is now in his fourth term and looking ahead to two more. : \"I'm looking into your eyes, and I don't think you have a soul\" \u2014 to which Putin, in Biden's rendering, smiled and replied: \"We understand one another.\" Three years later, when Russian troops seized Ukrainian territory, Biden became Obama's point man on Ukraine. Still, Putin knows Biden could become the next American president. Asked by a Russian TV reporter last week about his preferences, Putin tried to be diplomatic. \"We will work with any future president of the United States, with the person who will have the trust of the American people,\" he said. \"We know that President Trump has repeatedly spoken in favor of developing Russian-American relations. We certainly appreciate that very much,\" he said. He blamed a \"bipartisan consensus on the necessity of containing Russia\" for limiting Trump's room for maneuver. At the same time, Putin criticized the Trump administration for signing off on new sanctions and for withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year. As for Biden, Putin said the Democratic candidate used \"sharp anti-Russian rhetoric,\" but that the Kremlin was encouraged by Biden's interest in preserving the New START arms control treaty \u2014 originally negotiated by the Obama administration\u2014 that expires in February. Lipman cautions that the prospects for better relations are bleak no matter who wins. If Biden becomes president, he may consolidate European allies against Moscow, she says, while if Trump is reelected, his political opponents may pursue an even harsher policy toward Russia. The only thing that helps the Kremlin, Lipman says, is more polarization and turmoil in the United States. \"Turmoil means the United States weakened,\" she says. \"This is what the Kremlin can actually benefit from, not an improvement in relations. This is the only thing that Russia may hope for.\" "},

{"text": "Exclusive: stark conclusion shared between London, Berlin and Paris in effect points finger at Kremlin Western security agencies have privately concluded that the Russian opposition leader was poisoned by the country\u2019s FSB domestic spy agency, in effect pointing the finger at the Kremlin for ordering the attack. The stark conclusion has been shared between London, Berlin and Paris, among others, and underpins the to target the FSB chief, Alexander Bortnikov, with sanctions. European leaders have been quick to accuse the Russian state of being responsible for Navalny\u2019s poisoning in August, but remain reluctant to explicitly blame the agency they believe is responsible or President Western security sources, however, are confident about accusing the FSB in private, although the assertion is hard to test. On Thursday, the European commission dropped the strongest hint yet, explaining the reasoning for the sanctioning of Bortnikov . It said Navalny was being \u201cclosely monitored by the Federal Security Service [FSB] of the Russian Federation during his journey to Siberia in August 2020\u201d. Given that the Russian politician had been put under surveillance by the FSB, and that he had been poisoned with novichok, which is only available to Russian state actors, the commission said it believed the FSB was responsible. \u201cIn these circumstances and taking into account that was under surveillance at the time of his poisoning, it is reasonable to conclude that the poisoning was only possible with the involvement of the Federal Security Service,\u201d the official report said. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any involvement. It has offered varying explanations for Navalny\u2019s illness, including a claim that he Navalny collapsed on 20 August while on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. He fell into a coma and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. He was airlifted to Berlin three days later for emergency treatment and has since made a partial recovery. The opposition leader has accused Putin of being he said only two Russian agencies could have carried it out \u2013 Bortnikov\u2019s FSB or the SVR foreign intelligence service, run by Sergei Naryshkin. \u201cThis was done, of course, absolutely, according to Putin\u2019s orders,\u201d he said. Navalny said he was poisoned with the Soviet nerve agent novichok inside his Tomsk hotel room and became ill about three hours later. Traces of novichok were discovered on a , though Navalny said he did not know how exactly it was administered. only a state body could obtain novichok, which was developed during the latter years of the cold war in a secret Soviet laboratory. Bortnikov or Naryshkin must have come up with an order calling for the application of \u201cactive measures\u201d, with Putin signing off on it, Navalny said. Two sources say they believe the poisoning was undertaken by the , responsible for tackling terrorism, extremism and internal political threats on behalf of the Kremlin. They suggest the operation was designed not to kill Navalny but to send him an unambiguous warning and to force him into exile. , a London-based investigative unit, said the choice of novichok was deliberate. The FSB presides over a wide variety of poisons, many of them unknown. If it had wanted to kill Navalny, it could have done so, they stressed. Andrei Soldatov, an expert on Russia\u2019s security services, said the involvement of the Second Service was \u201centirely plausible\u201d. It is headed by , an ex-KGB officer from St Petersburg. He has known Putin since the 1990s and is said to be a longtime confidant. The service is closely modelled on the KGB\u2019s Fifth Directorate. In communist times the ideological department monitored dissident intellectuals. These days its remit includes a counter-terrorism department, allegedly involved in extrajudicial killings in the north Caucasus. Early in October, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Navalny had been poisoned with novichok, which can cause a heart attack or asphyxiation if administered in a high enough dose. The same poison was used against , UK. According to the British government, two undercover killers working for Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the GRU, on the door handle of Sergei Skripal\u2019s home. The Skripals, who survived, were treated with the antidote atropine, which was also used on Navalny. , died two months later after spraying the poison, which had been concealed in a perfume bottle, on her wrists. This week the British Foreign Office said: \u201cThe UK and its partners have agreed that there is no plausible explanation for Mr Navalny\u2019s poisoning, other than Russian involvement and responsibility.\u201d France and Germany\u2019s foreign ministers have repeatedly used near-identical language, complaining this month that Russia had not undertaken a full investigation and that \u201cno credible explanation has been provided by On Thursday the EU and UK announced sanctions against Bortnikov and five other people it said were behind the \u201cassassination attempt\u201d against Navalny. Bortnikov\u2019s assets will be frozen and he faces a travel ban. Also targeted are Sergei Kiriyenko, the first deputy chief of staff in Putin\u2019s administration; Andrei Yarin, another Kremlin official; Alexei Krivoruchko and Pavel Popov, both deputy ministers of defence; and Sergei Menyaylo, a presidential envoy to the Siberian federal district, where Navalny fell ill. in Moscow, was blacklisted.

{"text": "Trump's foreign-policy instincts might be more sound\u2014but he has forfeited the chance to lead. The killing of a coloured teenager in Johannesburg exposed the fraught state of race relations in South Africa\u2014and how the racial hierarchies created by apartheid continue to plague the country. Washington can reduce Moscow\u2019s influence and support Kurdish allies without a large troop presence in the region. For all the talk of a new administration boldly reengaging with the world after four years of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d Trump\u2019s strategic retrenchment can only be the start. From Belarus to Kyrgyzstan to Ukraine, the popular uprisings that have swept the post-Soviet world in the last two decades have had one feature in common: high levels of participation among millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Generation Z (1997 and 2012). In some ways, it appears that Russia\u2019s young people may be next. According to , in the last couple of years, younger Russians have become the group most dissatisfied with Russia\u2019s political system. But the obstacles that have so far kept the country\u2019s millennials and Gen Zers from reforming the system remain. For one, there\u2019s the sheer size of the younger generations, which, thanks to decades of low birth rates, constitute a small minority within Russian society. There simply may not be enough young people to successfully push for fundamental change. Second, many younger Russians refrain from actively participating in politics and only grow more politically engaged as they enter their early 30s. Yet the youth need not despair. Findings from our new study conducted with the Levada Center, an independent survey company, suggest ways in which the United States could help boost higher civic and political engagement in these age cohorts\u2014and, in turn, help them play a similar role as in Russia\u2019s neighboring countries. Several years ago, it was commonplace for concerned observers to younger Russians, who showed no inclination for challenging Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule, as anti-democratic, deeply conservative, and unprepared to fight for a more open future. Yet today, Russians aged 16-34 are the most cohort in the country. They also hold attitudes than the rest of the population, and the number of Russians below the age of 25 who is almost twice as high as the number of those who prioritize state interests. The opposite is true among older Russians. Younger Russians are also among the most opposition-minded groups in Russia. A steady decline in living standards has support for the authorities among all Russians, and it isn\u2019t hard to see why. Real incomes in Russia declined every year between 2014 and 2018, when the Russian Federal State Statistic Service the methodology for income reporting. In 2020, real incomes experienced the biggest they have seen in the last 20 years due to the pandemic-induced economic crisis. That, combined with an unpopular hike in the retirement age in 2018, has diminished Russians\u2019 faith in their country\u2019s political leaders. The lack of support is most pronounced among younger citizens. In June and July polling, 18- to 24-year-olds were the group most critical of Putin\u2019s rule (49-50 percent disapproved). And in a July study, 62 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds that Russia was heading in the wrong direction (as opposed to an average of 40 percent across other ages). According to the study, only 7 percent of young Russians Putin among politicians they trust (as opposed to 23 percent of the on average). And in August, only 23 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 31 percent of 25- to 39-year-olds surveyed they would vote for Putin if the elections were to take place the next Sunday, as compared with 40 percent of the population in general. Based on focus group discussions, younger and older Russians seem to share many of the same reasons for their dissatisfaction. These include concerns about Russia\u2019s economic problems and the country\u2019s future. However, there are age-specific issues, too, having mostly to do with younger Russians\u2019 different media habits. In particular, younger Russians are more to the internet and social networks. YouTube, for example, has to new public figures, such as the independent journalist and popular video blogger Yuri Dud, and independent politicians including Alexei Navalny. Because of their access to outside sources of information, younger Russians appear less vulnerable to Kremlin TV propaganda. Younger Russians are more positive toward the United States, which is constantly bedeviled by Russian state-controlled TV channels. Older, Russians (aged 55 and above) are less so. Younger Russians complain more often about restrictions on the internet and popular communications apps like Telegram. They are opposed to the criminal charges that can be waged for reposts and retweets deemed critical of Putin, and they have criticized the growing brutality of the authorities, such as the crackdown on Moscow protesters in the summer of 2019. In focus groups at the end of last summer, young residents from big cities repeatedly mentioned the case of Daria Sosnovskaya, a young woman who was deliberately punched in the stomach by a police officer at one protest. One of the videos that captured this moment gathered over 700,000 views on YouTube. Added together, increasing internet penetration and rising opposition to the authorities among younger Russians could chip away at Putin\u2019s power over the long term. However, several important obstacles remain. First, younger Russians are a minority within the Russian population, and their share keeps declining. According to the 2019 census, Russians aged 15-29 only 16.5 percent of the population due to the relatively small number of children born between 1989 and 2003. As recently as 2010, made up 24 percent of the population. This number, while significantly than in many Asian republics in the post-Soviet space, is comparable to , where 15- to 29-year-olds constitute 17.7 percent. In , the share of 15- to 24-year-olds is only 9.6 percent. Compounding the challenge of size, young Russians also have low rates of political participation. Surveys show that only about 20 percent of people aged 14-29 are in politics, and only 7 percent mention active participation in Russia\u2019s political life as a possibility in the future. Younger Russians follow the news and discuss political topics two times as older ones. They vote in elections of various levels three times less often. Lower interest in politics may explain the fact that, despite their growing dissatisfaction with the authorities, younger people have not increased as a share of all opposition protesters over the last decade. The figure at about 20-30 percent of protest participants. Instead, younger Russians tend stay politically engaged primarily online. For example, while younger Russians, even more than other age groups, the constitutional amendments introduced in 2020, which among other changes granted Putin a right to stay in power for two more consecutive terms, they have also disproportionally from voting during constitutional referenda, including a ballot in July 2020. This is a result of two processes. First, few young Russians thought that their vote would be decisive. Second, continuing disarray within Russia\u2019s opposition prevented it from offering a consolidated strategy for the constitutional amendments voting and mobilizing young Russians to participate. Still, although Russian millennials and Gen Zers are somewhat apolitical at the moment, in Russia interest in politics and in political participation tends to awaken later in life, closer to the age of 25-30. Data from our surveys shows that various indicators of adulthood, such as having a mortgage and kids and living separately from one\u2019s parents, predict higher political engagement among Russians. Until then, younger people tend to borrow politics from the adults who surround them. However, as these generations become more politically engaged, they may come to represent a real obstacle to Putin\u2019s rule\u2014through protests and at the ballot box. Already by 2024 this age cohort may grow to represent a substantial electoral challenge to the regime. that indicators of civic and political engagement are higher among those Russians between 16 and 34 who speak foreign languages and travel abroad. Other studies have also shown that young respondents who have even a short experience of traveling outside Russia demonstrate higher proclivity for independent thinking. The exposure to different values, norms, and ideas from other countries changes people\u2019s perception of the way things should work domestically. This suggests that fostering educational exchange programs in the United States may be one way to spur political activity among young Russians. is a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. is a deputy director at the Levada Center in Moscow. is a senior research fellow for the Levada Center. Ahead of this weekend\u2019s elections, the biggest threat to Putin is not a nationwide uprising\u2014it is a series of smaller protests over deeply felt local concerns.

{"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A New York tabloid\u2019s puzzling account about how it acquired emails purportedly from Joe Biden\u2019s son has raised some red flags. One of the biggest involves the source of the emails: Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani has traveled abroad looking for dirt on the Bidens, developing relationships with shadowy figures, including a Ukrainian lawmaker who U.S. officials have described as a Russian agent and part of a broader Russian effort to denigrate the Democratic presidential nominee. Yet Giuliani says foreign sources didn\u2019t provide the Hunter Biden emails. He says a laptop containing the emails and intimate photos was simply abandoned in a Delaware repair shop and the shop owner reached out to Giuliani\u2019s lawyer. That hasn\u2019t stopped the FBI from investigating whether the emails are part of a foreign influence operation. The emails have surfaced as U.S. officials have been warning that Russia, which backed Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign through hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign, is interfering again this year. The latest episode with Giuliani underscores the risk he poses to a White House that spent years confronted by a federal investigation into whether Trump associates had coordinated with Russia. The Washington Post reported Thursday that intelligence agencies had warned the White House last year that Giuliani was the target of a Russian influence operation. The newspaper, citing four former officials, said that assessment was based on information including intercepted communications showing Giuliani had been in contact with people tied to Russian intelligence. The newspaper said national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien had warned Trump that information Giuliani brought back from Ukraine should be considered contaminated by Russia, but that Trump brushed off the warning. Far from distancing himself from Giuliani, Trump has made the purported Hunter Biden emails one of his main talking points in the final weeks of the campaign as he tries to disparage his Democratic rival. The Trump-friendly New York Post began publishing stories about the emails Wednesday, saying it had obtained them from the former New York mayor. The newspaper said the emails of Hunter Biden, a California resident, were found in a laptop that had been dropped off for service at a Delaware repair shop by an unidentified man who never picked it up. They said the shop owner turned it over to the FBI, but also made a copy of the hard drive and provided that to Giuliani\u2019s lawyer. One 2015 email published by the Post purported to show a top adviser for Burisma, the Ukraine gas company where Hunter Biden held a board seat, thanking Biden for giving him an opportunity to meet his father when the older Biden was serving as U.S. vice president. The Biden campaign and a lawyer for Hunter Biden said they had no record of such a meeting taking place. They have not addressed the authenticity of the emails. Giuliani did not respond Friday for a request for comment from The Associated Press. But in an interview Thursday with a SiriusXM show, he asserted that the laptop had been dropped off by Hunter Biden, and that the material was not hacked and the laptop was legally obtained. He said on Fox News on Friday that the information from the laptop was \u201cauthentic as hell.\u201d The FBI is investigating whether the emails are tied to a foreign influence operation, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity to AP. The exact scope of what was being investigated was not clear. But the report that intelligence agencies have been concerned about Giuliani is hardly surprising. Andrii Derkach, the Ukrainian parliamentarian who is one of Giuliani\u2019s principal contacts, was mentioned in an August intelligence assessment that described a concerted Russian effort to disparage Biden. A Treasury Department sanction announcement from last month characterized Derkach as an \u201cactive Russian agent for over a decade.\u201d Derkach in recent months has leaked recordings of calls Biden had as vice president with Ukraine\u2019s then-leader, audio the Biden campaign contends is heavily edited. Despite his own administration\u2019s warnings on Derkach, Trump has promoted those recordings on Twitter. Giuliani has not been shy about discussing his foreign contacts, including with Derkach. In December, Derkach posted on his Facebook page photos of him and Giuliani meeting in Kyiv. Frustration about Giuliani in the West Wing has long run rampant, with those around the president warily watching Giuliani\u2019s efforts to bring down the Bidens and fearful they could boomerang back on the president. Giuliani was central to advancing a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election. His shadowy efforts to get Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens helped create the impeachment case against Trump. Even detractors in the president\u2019s orbit recognize Giuliani as a force in Trump\u2019s defense during the lengthy Russia investigation by the special counsel. The probe detailed extensive contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia but did not allege a criminal conspiracy between the two to tip the 2016 election. Yet the effort to undermine Robert Mueller led Giuliani to Ukraine, which many feel directly led to Trump\u2019s impeachment. He was acquitted by the Senate in February. After long struggling to find a cable-ready defender, Trump has been mostly appreciative of Giuliani\u2019s attack-dog style \u2014 and, for a time, his broadsides against Mueller appeared to play a role in driving down the special counsel\u2019s approval ratings. But at other times, the president has expressed private dismay at Giuliani\u2019s scattershot style. Some around Trump fear that the case being made against the younger Biden has been weakened because Giuliani has become its face. The Trump campaign has been pushing allegations of corruption against the Bidens for more than a year, with the president advancing the widely discredited theory that the vice president sought to force out Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor to protect his son from scrutiny. Though Trump associates believe a case can be made that Hunter enriched himself by selling access to his father, they fear that Giuliani\u2019s lack of credibility will cause the allegations to implode. Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire in New York and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report. "},
{"text": "Fueled by the pandemic, uprisings in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan and a war in the Caucasus region are undermining the influence of the Russian leader. YEREVAN, Armenia \u2014 In Russia\u2019s self-proclaimed sphere of influence, Russia is losing its influence. Concurrent crises in Belarus, Central Asia and the Caucasus region have blindsided the Kremlin, leaving it scrambling to shore up Russian interests in former Soviet republics and undermining President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s image as a master tactician on the world stage. \u201cThere is nothing good about these conflicts for Moscow,\u201d Konstantin Zatulin, a senior Russian lawmaker and Putin ally who specializes in relations with what Russians call their \u201cnear abroad.\u201d Mr. Putin has spent years building up Russia as a global power, with a hand in hot spots from Latin America to the Middle East, and even meddling in presidential elections in the United States. But after working for years to destabilize the West, he suddenly finds himself surrounded by instability; once seen as sure-handed in foreign affairs, he seems to have lost his touch. In Belarus, Mr. Putin responded to a street uprising in August by propping up the country\u2019s unpopular autocrat, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, turning public opinion against Russia in what had previously been Europe\u2019s most Russia-friendly country. in Central Asia, protesters this week appeared President Sooronbai Jeenbekov, less than two weeks after Mr. Putin in a rare in-person meeting that \u201cwe will do everything to support you as the head of state.\u201d And in the Caucasus, the long-simmering conflict between over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh erupted last week into , threatening to undo the balancing act that had allowed Russia to cultivate diverse links to the region. \u201cRussia was doing all it could to maintain ties both with Azerbaijan and Armenia,\u201d Mr. Zatulin said. \u201cEvery day of conflict in Karabakh is, effectively, helping zero out Russia\u2019s authority.\u201d The spate of new challenges to Russian influence strikes at the heart of Mr. Putin\u2019s yearslong effort to cast himself as the leader who restored the great-power status that the nation lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even as the Kremlin denied Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election, Russian state television gleefully reported on the American allegations of that interference as a sign that Moscow was being reckoned with again on the world stage. Now, rather than react decisively to emergencies close to home, Mr. Putin sounds ambivalent about Russia\u2019s role. \u201cWe hope the conflict will end very soon,\u201d he said of Nagorno-Karabakh, in a television interview broadcast Wednesday. Minutes later, referring to Kyrgyzstan, he said, \u201cWe hope that everything will be peaceful.\u201d The confluence of crises in Russia\u2019s own neighborhood is such that some pro-Kremlin commentators of an organized campaign to sow discord in the post-Soviet regions. More balanced analysts, however, have singled out one constant factor in the growing unrest. Both Russia and its neighbors, they say, have been destabilized by the coronavirus pandemic, which has exposed distrust in institutions and in out-of-touch leaders across the region. between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and in Belarus and in Kyrgyzstan, the disease set the stage for public uprisings by exposing the ruling elite as disconnected from people\u2019s suffering. Mr. Lukashenko angered Belarusians by playing down the danger of the virus, joking that ; in Kyrgyzstan, critics blamed officials for using coronavirus aid money to enrich themselves. Within Russia, the economic hardship caused by the pandemic has helped deepen public anger against Mr. Putin. In the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk, for example, thousands of protesters spilled into the streets last Saturday for the 13th week in a row. Some analysts say that public discontent within Russia means that Mr. Putin needs to turn more of his focus to domestic issues such as economy hardship, pollution and poor health care, rather than delving into global geopolitics. But developments in recent weeks have given Mr. Putin more reason to focus on the latter. \u201cFor Putin, practically his entire mission and his vision of Russian greatness and success revolve around his foreign-policy agenda,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research organization focused on politics and policy. The new series of crises, she went on, \u201cwill very much distract Putin from domestic problems.\u201d The centrality of the former Soviet lands to Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy was evident in the of world leaders who called Mr. Putin to wish him a happy birthday on Wednesday, when he turned 68. Of the 12 who called, only three leaders \u2014 those of Israel, India and Cuba \u2014 head countries outside the former Soviet Union. In Armenia, which hosts a Russian military base, some hope for a more forceful stance by Russia in the conflict, which has already killed at least 250 people, according to official reports. But Russia\u2019s ability to influence events in the Caucasus now appears limited, despite its past role as a mediator in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Turkey, Azerbaijan\u2019s most important ally, has taken on \u201cTurkey, indeed, in this current situation probably should be considered as a balance to unilateral Russian interference,\u201d said Farid Shafiyev, chairman of the Center of Analysis of International Relations in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku. In the Caucasus, he added, \u201cthe Russian role is probably diminishing.\u201d Across the former Soviet Union, Russian remains the lingua franca, and the proliferation of mostly uncensored internet access across the region means that protests in one country can easily inspire a disenchanted populace in another. Some protesters in Belarus carried signs supporting the demonstrations in Khabarovsk, over 4,000 miles away. And ahead of Kyrgyzstan\u2019s parliamentary elections last Sunday, government critics were keeping an eye on Belarus, where it was a blatantly falsified election in August that sparked the uprising against Mr. Lukashenko. \u201cIn Kyrgyzstan it was often said that we will copy the Belarusians,\u201d said Aybek Sultangaziyev, director of a news agency in Kyrgyzstan, K-News. \u201cIn fact, we surpassed the Belarusians in effectiveness and precision.\u201d Mr. Sultangaziyev said that if his country\u2019s uprising succeeds, the new leadership will seek to maintain close ties with Moscow. In Armenia, too, the government of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan retained its alliance with Russia after the prime minister came to power in a popular uprising in 2018. \u201cWe have never been pro-Western or pro-Eastern,\u201d said Ruben Rubinyan, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Armenian Parliament. \u201cRussia has been and is an ally of Armenia, a very important ally.\u201d But, for Moscow, recent events in Belarus offer a cautionary tale that illustrates the fragility of Russia\u2019s standing among its neighbors from Russia\u2019s orbit in 2014. Some Belarusians who had been well disposed toward Mr. Putin turned against him after he propped up Mr. Lukashenko in the face of the protests. Mr. Zatulin, the Russian lawmaker, said officials \u201cat the highest levels of the Russian Federation\u201d believed that Mr. Lukashenko would need to step down \u201csooner or later.\u201d But Mr. Lukashenko had argued to Russian officials, Mr. Zatulin said, that his stepping down in the face of street protests could set a dangerous precedent for what might happen to Mr. Putin himself. \u201cBy unconditionally supporting Lukashenko, we are creating an enormous problem for ourselves in the future with the majority or a significant part of the Belarusian population,\u201d Mr. Zatulin said. \u201cWe are creating a problem for ourselves with the other Belarusian politicians and public figures, who are increasingly forced to seek sympathy in the West. Russia wants that least of all.\u201d Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow. "},
{"text": "KESTER, Belgium (AP) \u2014 To a few of the locals, the top-secret, fenced-off installation on the hill is known as \u201cthe radar station.\u201d Some folks claim to have seen mysterious Russians in the area. Over the years, rumors have swirled that it might be a base for U.S. nuclear warheads. It\u2019s easy to see how the rumors start. The site is visually striking. Four huge white Kevlar balls sit like giant spherical spacecraft in a compound in the middle of open farm country 25 kilometers (16 miles) west of Belgium\u2019s capital, Brussels. But the Kester Satellite Ground Station is both safer and more sophisticated than local lore might suggest. It\u2019s central to space communications at NATO \u2014 the biggest and most modern of four such stations the military alliance runs. Around 2,000 satellites orbit the earth, over half operated by NATO countries, ensuring everything from mobile phone and banking services to weather forecasts. NATO commanders in places like Afghanistan or Kosovo rely on some of them to navigate, communicate, share intelligence and detect missile launches. This week, the site at Kester is set to fall under a new orbit, when NATO announces that it is creating a space center to help manage satellite communications and key parts of its military operations around the world. In December, NATO leaders declared space to be the alliance\u2019s \u201cfifth domain\u201d of operations, after land, sea, air and cyberspace. Over two days of talks starting Thursday, NATO defense ministers will greenlight a new space center at the alliance\u2019s Air Command in Ramstein, Germany. \u201cThis will be a focal point for ensuring space support to NATO operations, sharing information and coordinating our activities,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting. It\u2019s part of the alliance\u2019s efforts to keep ahead in a fast moving and hi-tech sector, particularly amid concern about what member countries say is increasingly aggressive behavior in space by China and Russia. Around 80 countries have satellites and private companies are moving in too. In the 1980s, just a fraction of NATO\u2019s communications was via satellite. Today, it\u2019s at least 40%. During the Cold War, NATO had more than 20 stations, but new technologies mean the world\u2019s biggest security organization can double its coverage with a fifth of that number. At Kester, behind a double security fence, massive steel gates and bulletproof glass in a facility that can withstand a terror attack or any attempt to jam communications, four satellite dishes ensconced in Kevlar domes connect NATO\u2019s civilian and military headquarters in Belgium to their operations around the world. From their elevated position, the dishes \u2014 two of them 16 meters (52 feet) in diameter \u2014 beam information and imagery down across Europe and over Africa into space above the equator where satellites owned by allies like the United States, Britain, France and Italy orbit. NATO itself doesn\u2019t own any satellites. Around the globe, commanders in ships, aircraft and mobile or static headquarters decrypt the data to gather orders, pictures and intelligence, prepare missions, or move troops and military equipment. From Kester, new lines of communication can be set up for NATO within a half-hour. Much of the facility is encased in thick steel plates, including the ducts where cables run, to withstand any attack by electromagnetic pulses \u2014 high bursts of energy that can knock out electrical power grids or destroy electronic circuit boards and components. But NATO allies are increasingly concerned about other kinds of attacks using anti-satellite weapons miles above the earth which could wreak havoc below and leave dangerous debris adrift in space. \u201cSome nations \u2013 including Russia and China \u2013 are developing anti-satellite systems which could blind, disable or shoot down satellites and create dangerous debris in orbit. We must increase our understanding of the challenges in space and our ability to address them,\u201d Stoltenberg said. For the moment, the military alliance insists that its \u201capproach will remain defensive and fully in line with international law.\u201d And despite the strides being made in the \u201cfifth domain,\u201d Stoltenberg has repeatedly said over the last year that \u201cNATO has no intention to put weapons in space.\u201d "},

Please give now to support our work Unlawful Attacks on Hospitals, Schools, Markets Forced Idlib Population Out The Syrian and Russian armed forces\u2019 repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure in Idlib in northwest were apparent war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Dozens of unlawful air and ground strikes on hospitals, schools, and markets from April 2019 to March 2020 killed hundreds of civilians. The attacks seriously impaired the rights to health, education, food, water, and shelter, triggering mass displacement. Syrian and Russian Strikes on Civilian Infrastructure Download the full report in English Annex I: Table of Strikes Documented by Human Rights Watch Annex II: Human Rights Watch Letters to the Governments of Syria and Russia Annex III: Confirmation of Receipt from Russian Government ,\u201d details abuses by Syrian and Russian armed forces during the 11-month military campaign to retake Idlib governorate and surrounding areas, among the last held by anti-government armed groups. The report examines the abusive military strategy in which the Syrian-Russian alliance repeatedly violated the laws of war against the 3 million civilians there, many displaced by fighting elsewhere in the country. It names 10 senior Syrian and Russian civilian and military officials who may be implicated in war crimes as a matter of command responsibility: they knew or should have known about the abuses and took no effective steps to stop them or punish those responsible. \u201cThe Syrian-Russian alliance strikes on Idlib\u2019s hospitals, schools, and markets showed callous disregard for civilian life,\u201d said , executive director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe repeated unlawful attacks appear part of a deliberate military strategy to destroy civilian infrastructure and force out the population, making it easier for the Syrian government to retake control.\u201d Human Rights Watch documented 46 air and ground attacks, including the use of cluster munitions, that directly hit or damaged civilian objects and infrastructure in Idlib in violation of the laws of war. The strikes killed at least 224\u00a0civilians and wounded 561. These were only a fraction of the total attacks during that time in Idlib and surrounding areas. The offensive displaced 1.4 million people, most in the final months of the operation. How five researchers exposed the abusive military strategy behind repeated attacks on civilians in northern Syria \u2014 without ever visiting the sites. Explore a new interactive feature and learn how we reached the truth. Human Rights Watch interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses of the 46 attacks, as well as healthcare and rescue workers, teachers, local authorities, and experts on the Syrian and Russian militaries. Human Rights Watch also examined dozens of satellite images and over 550 photographs and videos taken at the attack sites, as well as logs of flight spotters. Human Rights Watch provided a summary of its findings and questions to the Syrian and Russian governments but has not received a response. The documented strikes, most in and around four urban areas \u2013 Ariha, Idlib City, Jisr al-Shughour, and Maarat al-Nu\u2019man \u2013 damaged 12 healthcare facilities and 10 schools, forcing them to shut down, in some cases permanently. The attacks also damaged at least 5 markets, 4 displaced people\u2019s camps, 4 residential neighborhoods, 2 commercial areas, and a prison, church, stadium, and nongovernmental organization office. Human Rights Watch found no evidence of military objectives, including personnel or materiel, in the vicinity at the time of any of the attacks, and no residents interviewed knew of any advance warning. The overwhelming majority of attacks were far from active fighting between Syrian government forces and anti-government armed groups. The repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure in populated areas in which there was no apparent military objective suggests that these unlawful attacks were deliberate. The attacks appear intended to deprive civilians of the means to sustain themselves and to force them to flee, or to instill terror in the population, Human Rights Watch said. A resident of Idlib City, Ayman Assad, described the impact of the airstrikes: \u201cWe are terrified. I don\u2019t feel safe at my place of work, and at the same time I am constantly worried about my family, especially my two children who are going to school every day. Schools, markets, homes, hospitals, everything is a target. They are targeting life in Idlib.\u201d Most of the attacks documented appeared to involve explosive weapons with wide-area effects in . The use of such weapons in populated areas can indiscriminately kill and wound large numbers of civilians, and damage and destroy civilian objects and infrastructure. They also have reverberating effects \u2013 disrupting essential services, such as health care, education, and access to food and shelter. Long-term impacts include serious psychological harm to the people affected. Warring parties should avoid the use of these weapons in populated areas, Human Rights Watch said. Prior to a ceasefire in March, government forces regained control of nearly half the territory in and around Idlib, including hundreds of depopulated towns and villages. Since then, some people have returned to areas still controlled by anti-government armed groups, where they found a decimated infrastructure and limited access to food, water, shelter, health care, and education. The Covid-19 pandemic has placed the area\u2019s destroyed healthcare system under immense strain, further imperiling civilians. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President in getting Turkey, Russia, and Syria to agree to a Any resumption of fighting would expose civilians to renewed attacks from explosive weapons and the added risk of Covid-19, possibly triggering mass displacement with catastrophic humanitarian consequences. Displaced people could seek to cross Syria\u2019s northern border, where Turkish forces have previously asylum seekers, Human Rights Watch said. International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, requires all warring parties to direct attacks on military objectives, avoid harming civilians or civilian objects, and not carry out attacks that cause indiscriminate or disproportionate civilian harm. Populations also remain protected by international human rights law, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which protects the rights to health, education, and an adequate standard of living. Given the deadlock within the United Nations Security Council, the General Assembly should adopt a resolution or statement calling on its member states to impose targeted sanctions on those civilian and military commanders credibly implicated in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or other serious violations committed. Concerned governments should pursue criminal cases under the principle of universal jurisdiction and impose unilateral targeted sanctions against commanders and officials implicated in war crimes, including as a matter of command responsibility. To address the humanitarian situation, particularly in light of the pandemic, the Security Council should reauthorize cross-border aid deliveries across all three previously authorized border crossings in the northwest and northeast. If the Security Council proves unable to reauthorize cross-border deliveries due to the threat of veto by Russia, the General Assembly should pass a resolution to support the UN continuing cross-border deliveries to areas not under the Syrian government\u2019s control. \u201cConcerted international efforts are needed to demonstrate that there are consequences for unlawful attacks, to deter future atrocities, and to show that no one can elude accountability for grave crimes because of their rank or position,\u201d Roth said. \u201cAs long as impunity reigns, so too will the specter of renewed unlawful attacks and their devastating human toll.\u201d Syrian and Russian Strikes on Civilian Infrastructure Obstruction of Aid in Yemen During Covid-19 Human Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.

{"text": "While U.S. intelligence experts generally agree that Russia is better than any other country at spreading disinformation to undermine voter confidence leading up to the election, security experts have been preoccupied with a longer-term threat. They fear that the Chinese government's disinformation operations pose a far more insidious menace to democracy that will continue well past Election Day. Scholars studying the efforts say the Chinese are growing bolder and more brazen, often taking pages from what used to be seen as Russia's playbook in discrediting the United States. It's a pattern so troubling to global intelligence officials that last week, Ken McCallum, the incoming intelligence chief of the British domestic security service, MI5, said that if \"We are in a competition between democratic systems and autocratic systems of government,\" said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, part of the nonprofit German Marshall Fund of the United States, who follows the changing dynamics. \"China has grown in its geopolitical and economic clout and is trying to portray itself as a system that is equally legitimate to democratic governance. That is fundamentally in opposition to U.S. interests.\" While Chinese government officials vigorously deny that they are interfering in the presidential election, they also stress that they plan to preserve their reputation on the global stage. \"We are not interested and have never interfered in the U.S. presidential election,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a news briefing Sept. 23. \"On the contrary \u2014 the world sees clearly who has been wantonly meddling in other countries' domestic affairs.\" Russia has used disinformation methods to covertly sow division and conspiracy theories in the U.S. for decades, experts said. In the internet age, that has translated into paying operatives to manipulate public opinion through social media. It also includes a large English-language propaganda network, which includes Russian television and related websites. Those websites seek to promote stories that both aggravate political tensions in the U.S. and cast the country in an especially bad light to the rest of the world by highlighting its violent protests, its racial strife and what the sites portray as its governmental incompetence. China's information operations historically have focused more on elevating China's global standing than on attacking the U.S. and the West. As trade relationships increase around the globe, China does not want to appear as a rogue operator, experts said. It wants to make sure its global counterparts recognize its geopolitical strength. \"Basically, the only business we do with Russia is arms control and purchases of Stolichnaya vodka,\" said a senior congressional official briefed on intelligence matters who was not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. \"The Russians want to take us down with them. The Chinese can't afford to see us in chaos, because we are their biggest market. They are trying to accelerate the relative decline of the United States and their ascension to primacy.\" To do that, the Chinese Communist Party has been building what it calls \"discourse power\" by shaping a narrative that its model of government is superior to democratic government structures. The goal, experts said, is to develop more influence overseas, particularly among America's , who have been alienated by President Donald Trump, and to ultimately replace the U.S. as the dominant world power. \"The infrastructure and bureaucracy from China is more designed to present their point of view and persuade potentially sympathetic audiences around the world, especially in diaspora communities,\" said Graham Bookie, the acting director and managing editor of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, a nonprofit international affairs think tank. Over the last 18 months, however, the Chinese have started to take pages from Russia's playbook. Bookie said they have been using both covert and overt tactics to manipulate public opinion, including outright disinformation. \"We have seen more of a willingness to engage in more aggressive influence operations, including some of the stuff we would associate with Russia,\" Bookie said. For example, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese agents created fake social media accounts to push out false messages on Twitter and in texts that the Trump administration was planning to lock down the country. In mid-March, the National Security Council countered the rumors, \"Ultimately, China doesn't hesitate to use smoke, mirrors and misdirection to influence Americans,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a speech in July to the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank. China has extended the new tactics to other countries. In a report titled \" ,\" the social media research company Graphika identified Facebook posts praising China's generosity in offering coronavirus vaccines to the Philippines and commending its president, Rodrigo Duterte, after he said China was \" \" of the South China Sea. China's disinformation campaigns still clearly need refining. In August 2019, Twitter took down 936 troll accounts that it linked to Chinese state actors. The accounts, some of which claimed to be from U.S. cities, pushed conspiracy theories about pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Little effort was put into making the accounts seem like plausible human personas, according to . Many of the accounts had previously been used to push spamlike promotional links for companies, and they would tweet in a wide range of languages, including Chinese, Indonesian, Arabic, English and Spanish. Researchers at Graphika identified an inauthentic pro-Chinese network called \" ,\" which over the summer posted clumsily made English-language videos attacking U.S. policy and the Trump administration on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. The videos, which had robotic voice-overs in English, criticized the U.S. over issues like how police were treating anti-racism protesters. But the videos failed to attract any viewers. \"I've not yet found a Spamouflage video where I could reliably demonstrate that a real person engaged with it. All the engagement was from other members of the operation,\" said Graphika's director of investigations, Ben Nimmo. China's direct efforts to influence the presidential election have been limited. In its \"Naval Gazing\" research, Graphika analyzed a cluster of fake Facebook and Instagram groups, pages and profiles attributed to individuals in China that posted about many issues, including the U.S. election. However, the accounts focused far more on topics like maritime security in the South China Sea. Only three groups actually directly discussed the U.S. election, including one created in April 2019 called \"Go for Pete Buttigieg 2020,\" which had only two members by last month. In mid-2020, the operation created a group called Trump KAG 2020, which posted pro-Trump messaging, and another called Biden Harris 2020. When Facebook took the pages down early last month, the Biden Harris page had 1,400 members, and the Trump group had three. \"I would question whether the goal was election interference,\" Nimmo said. \"You're not going to make a dent on the American internet with three groups with a combined membership of less than 1,500 people.\" Some experts suggest thinking of the election as a testing ground for Chinese information operations. \"It's been a 'throw everything at the wall and see what sticks' approach,\" said Chloe Colliver, head of digital policy and strategy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an anti-extremism policy institute in London. Briefing the congressional intelligence committees last month, National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe said dozens of lawmakers had been more broadly targeted by Chinese influence campaigns, a fact first reported by An intelligence official who was not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified said the intelligence community \"has become aware of Chinese influence operations targeting members of Congress at a rate of approximately six times that of Russia and 12 times that of Iran.\" Still, the senior congressional official who was briefed on intelligence matters said, China's efforts to influence lawmakers are intended not to influence the election of one candidate over another but to broadly expose flaws in the U.S. The approach will only grow, national security officials said, and it will go beyond propaganda and social media. \"China is engaged in a highly sophisticated malign foreign influence campaign, and its methods include bribery, blackmail and covert deals,\" Wray, the FBI director, said in July. \"Chinese diplomats also use both open, naked economic pressure and seemingly independent middlemen to push China's preferences on American officials.\" Olivia Solon is a tech investigations editor for NBC News in San Francisco.

BERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s bedside visit to Aleksei A. Navalny after he emerged from a coma while recovering from a poisoning was not a secret, her office insisted. Nor was it official. Russia\u2019s leading opposition figure, was a purely private affair, her spokesman said. Neither Mr. Navalny\u2019s full military police escort to the Charit\u00e9 hospital upon his arrival in Berlin by air ambulance in August nor the dispatching of a security detail that has watched over him ever since is any indication of official favor, Steffen Seibert, the chancellor\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cFrom the first day, the German government has made it clear that Mr. Navalny was here in on humanitarian reasons,\u201d Mr. Seibert said. But the public and official attention surrounding Mr. Navalny\u2019s arrival and treatment in Germany after his poisoning has raised this question: Will Berlin now take a tougher stance against Moscow amid \u201cOf course, one always thinks that a new low point in German-Russian relations has been reached, then it gets even worse, and the next thing happens,\u201d said Dr. Stefan Meister, head of the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation\u2019s South Caucasus Office. \u201cWith every point the pressure grows, also from the public, for the German government to harden its stance toward Russia.\u201d Still, experts are skeptical that either Berlin or the European Union has the political will to take concrete action, or to unite split interests, that would send a clear message to Russia. Russia has maintained that it played no role in ; last week the foreign ministry in Moscow accused Germany of dramatizing the episode. German and other European experts, though, say Mr. Navalny was attacked with a military-grade chemical from the Novichok group, a Soviet-designed chemical weapon. Use of the substance would be a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention to which Moscow is a signatory, raising the prospect that Germany could lead the European Union to enact painful sanctions against Moscow. The watchdog for that convention, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, is expected to release in the coming days the results of its own analysis of biomedical samples collected from Mr. Navalny by its team of experts, the agency said last week. But Mr. Meister said he does not see the E.U.\u2019s 27 members finding a consensus to enact sanctions. That is especially so, he said, after the to impose economic sanctions on the leader of Belarus, , after the fraudulent election in that country, crackdown on opposition leaders, and beatings and arrests of peaceful protesters. \u201cThe political will to take a harder stance against Russia is absent,\u201d Mr. Meister said of the European Union. He added that Berlin\u2019s own policy toward Moscow remained \u201cstuck in its internal contradictions and compromises.\u201d Nevertheless, over the past six years, since the Russians sent soldiers without insignia \u2014 the \u2014 into Crimea, Berlin\u2019s position toward Moscow has shifted gradually, said Gustav C. Gressel, a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. The pro-Russia stance that for decades has been the trademark of the center-left Social Democrats \u2014 currently junior partners in Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing coalition \u2014 has been chipped away at by Moscow\u2019s increasingly bold steps toward Berlin. These include carrying out in a Berlin park last year. \u201cAll of those who call for appeasement, insisting that we have to respect Russia, are becoming less popular,\u201d Mr. Gressel said, and increasingly, it is the hard-liners against Russia who are being heard. That does not translate into immediate action on Germany\u2019s part, however. Early calls to cancel the nearly completed, $11 billion from Russia to Germany have faded, and Ms. Merkel\u2019s government has insisted it will seek a European response to the poisoning. But from the outset Ms. Merkel has taken an unusually personal interest in Mr. Navalny\u2019s fate. She granted him swift entry to Germany even though most Russians are barred, given the threat of the coronavirus, and personally announced in notably harsh terms the discovery that Novichok had turned up in the tests on Mr. Navalny \u2014 which the chancellor in Speaking to reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron of France echoed the chancellor\u2019s demand for Russia to explain what had happened to Mr. Navalny before a meeting of the European Council, part of the European Union\u2019s executive arm, on Thursday and Friday. The poisoning has been added to that meeting\u2019s agenda. \u201cThis is very clearly a murder attempt carried out on Russian soil, against a Russian opposition leader with a chemical agent manipulated in Russia,\u201d Mr. Macron told the reporters, according to Reuters. \u201cIt is therefore up to Russia to provide clarifications.\u201d \u2014 which sanctions those found to be in violation of human rights \u2014 would give the bloc an additional tool to use against Moscow in Mr. Navalny\u2019s case. But even if Europe does pull together its own version, Mr. Meister expects that those affected would be limited largely to individuals who do not regularly conduct business outside of Russia. The bigger question, though, will be how Russia decides to treat Mr. Navalny once he returns home as he has said he plans to do, said Janis Kluge, an analyst for Eastern Europe with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. in 20 years of speeches and interviews. But Mr. Navalny has now met with the German chancellor, whether officially or otherwise, and his poisoning has become the focus of an investigation by an international institution to which Russia is a signatory member. \u201cIt\u2019s about how Moscow now deals with the case, much more than about Mr. Navalny himself,\u201d Mr. Kluge said. \u201cRussia could have at least launched an investigation into what happened to him, but the fact that they haven\u2019t done so yet shows how little Moscow really cares that Europe and Germany are shocked.\u201d "},

Moscow has rejected the claim, calling it a \"serious and wilful provocation.\" that Norway's security and intelligence services were \"co-operating closely to deal with this matter at the national level.\" at the \"unacceptable\" announcement, saying no evidence had been presented. \"Millions of cyber attacks are annually committed from abroad against Russian state internet resources... but this does not give us the right to indiscriminately blame authorities of the countries of their possible origin,\" the embassy added. In September, Norwegian authorities said that email accounts belonging to several officials had been compromised during a cyber-attack, and some information had been downloaded. But the full extent of damage caused by the hack has not been made public. Norway's allegation comes during a time of increasingly strained relations with Russia. Both countries share an Arctic border, and Norway is a member of Nato. In August, Norway expelled a Russian diplomat on suspicion of spying. Russia retaliated by expelling a Norwegian diplomat days later. Norway also arrested a Russian national in 2018 who was suspected of gathering information on the country's parliamentary network. The individual was later released due to a lack of evidence. In a report earlier this year, Norway's military intelligence agency warned that Russia was trying to fuel discord in the country through so-called influence operations, aimed at weakening public trust in the government, election processes and the media. National legislatures are a key source of policy-related information, and so are frequently targeted by hacking campaigns. In January, the personal details of hundreds of German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, were stolen and published online.

{"text": "Yandex is the crown jewel of Russia\u2019s silicon valley\u2014but is often caught between the demands of the government and Wall Street. Russia\u2019s biggest technology company enjoys a level of dominance that is unparalleled by any one of its Western counterparts. Think Google mixed with equal parts Amazon, Spotify and Uber and you\u2019re getting close to the sprawling empire that is Yandex\u2014a single, mega-corporation with its hands in everything from search to ecommerce to driverless cars. But being the crown jewel of Russia\u2019s silicon valley has its drawbacks. The country\u2019s government sees the internet as contested territory amid ever-present tensions with US and other Western interests. As such, it wants influence over how Yandex uses its massive trove of data on Russian citizens. Foreign investors, meanwhile, are more interested in how that data can be turned into growth and profit. of MIT Technology Review, Moscow-based journalist Evan Gershkovich explains how Yandex\u2019s ability to walk could potentially serve as a kind of template for Big Tech. This week on Deep Tech, he joins our editor-in-chief, Gideon Lichfield, to discuss how, in a world where the debates over regulating Big Tech are intensifying, this isn\u2019t just a Russian story. Imagine a world where Google, Amazon, Spotify, and Uber are all one company. Everything from your morning news, music, and groceries, to your taxi home at night all delivered and operated by a single mega-corporation. Well, head over to Russia and you\u2019ll find that world is very much a reality. Yandex is the crown jewel of Russia\u2019s Silicon Valley. It has its hands in everything from search to autonomous vehicles. It even got an extra boost from the coronavirus pandemic. for the company\u2019s delivery apps grew in the second quarter of this year. But that success comes at a price. Russia has long-viewed the internet as a battleground in its escalating tensions with the West. of Russia\u2019s power-brokers think Yandex is under too much foreign influence. They want Russia to have ultimate control of the massive amounts of data that tech companies hold on Russian citizens. That means Yandex periodically gets caught between the demands of the Kremlin and of the foreign investors who hold most of its stock. But as we\u2019ll see today, in a world where the debates over how to regulate Big Tech are intensifying, this isn\u2019t just the Russian story. Today, I\u2019m talking to Evan Gershkovich, a journalist for the Moscow Times. He wrote a story in our latest issue\u2014the techno-nationalism issue\u2014about Yandex\u2019s balancing act, and how it be seen as a kind of template for tech companies in the rest of the world. I\u2019m Gideon Lichfield, editor-in-chief of MIT Technology Review, and So Evan, when I lived in Moscow 15 years ago, people were already using Yandex Search and Yandex Maps and Yandex Translate, but it seems to have become way, way bigger since then. Can you give us a sense of how important it is? Yandex started expanding very much in the way that Google did over the years, starting from just a search engine to becoming a service that provided...or a company that provided a variety of different services. And now when you live in Moscow, 15 years later, So many services are connected to this company from ordering food to ride sharing services, to figuring out what movies you're going to watch. And this year during the coronavirus crisis when Moscow was under lockdown, Yandex really became this sort of all-encompassing company because people relied on its taxi service and people also used its food delivery services to ensure they weren't going to the supermarket so much. So it really became this sort of dominant presence in our lives here. How did Yandex get to be so totally dominant in, in a way that not even Google is in the West? How does it beat out the competition? What the company will tell you when you ask them this question is that it's through this diversification. About 10 years ago, around 2012, 2013, the company decided to start diversifying way beyond just the search and the maps, like you had mentioned. If you look at, you know, their movie recommending service, or if you look at their website that they have where you can buy cars or Navigator, they all have a competitor in Russia. So they don't dominate every single industry fully, but they are pretty much everywhere. And in this way, you just, you know, anything you try to do online in Russia, Yandex comes up as a very plausible tool that you would use. There's this phenomenon in China, where the government went out of its way to help local tech giants beat out foreign competition. And one of the big things there, of course, is that the local firms are willing to cooperate with surveillance and censorship in a way that Google isn't, for example. But in Russia, Yandex didn't really have that sort of help, did it? It just kind of grew by itself. Yeah, absolutely. For years the Kremlin and other state security services didn't really pay attention to the internet all that much. They were, the authorities here and Russia, were quite slow to coming around to the idea that this was an area that they should pay attention to. And this could be paradoxical or sound odd to a Western audience, but for years, Russia's internet was really the freest internet or.. one of the freest internets that there was in the world. So Yandex, which started in 97\u2019 and grew in the early aughts and through the 2010s, at that point, really, it wasn't touched. And so it was free to develop how it wanted to. And when did this mentality of the Kremlin start to change? When did they start to think that a company as powerful as Yandex was going to be a problem? One of the first moments was in 2008 when Russia fought a five day war with Georgia. One of Yandex's services is called Yandex News, it's a sort of a news aggregator very similar to Google News. And at that point Russian media was much more diversified. There was many more independent and liberal outlets. And so Yandex's aggregator was picking up liberal and independent media news about the war and putting it in its feed and that really upset the Kremlin, which wanted its viewpoint to be highlighted. Several years later when the Arab Spring swept across the Middle East in 2011, and then protests kicked off in Moscow against Vladimir Putin's rule in Russia a few months later, that was really sort of this moment where the Kremlin saw the internet specifically as an arena that could be influential. Because all those protests in the Arab Spring and then in Moscow were organized through Facebook and similar social media tools. The Kremlin realized what power that the internet actually could have. So in both the war three years earlier in 2008, and then in 2011 during these mass protests, it started to sort of realize that this was an arena that it would if not control, at least pay close attention to. And what kind of pressure did it start to put on Yandex? So one of the first moments of pressure that Yandex actually faced was a potential takeover by Kremlin-linked oligarch Alisher Usmanov. He lobbied for the Kremlin support on national security grounds to take over the company. And a year later, in 2009, Yandex handed Russia's largest lender, the state owned Sberbank a so-called \u201cgolden share,\u201d which allowed the bank to veto transactions involving more than a quarter of Yandex's stock. And this was essentially meant to satisfy the Kremlin that if there were any transactions the authorities weren't happy with, they would be able to step in and limit them. And what's been going on in the years since then? So for about a decade this sort of golden-share arrangement seemed to satisfy the Kremlin and interest in Yandex pretty much waxed and waned. It was sort of left to its own devices until the fall of 2018 when rumors surfaced that Sberbank was now hoping to buy a 30% stake in Yandex to protect it from so-called \"potential trouble.\" That morning in New York, when trading opened up // the company lost a billion dollars in market value over these worries. Now How much leverage do you think Yandex has? It\u2019s one of Russia\u2019s biggest companies. It\u2019s majority owned by foreign investors. And obviously if Russia clips its wings, its share price would take a huge hit. Does that matter, do you think, to the authorities? To the authorities, it seems like, not so much. Often it makes these decisions out of purely, you know, their own interests. But when there were these rumors that we spoke about, about Sberbank buying a 30% share in Yandex, it really appeared to be that that was coming from the Kremlin saying, you know, we have to sort of rein in Yandex. And Yandex solved that with what seems to be a really neat solution. It took about a year, but they changed that golden-share, that veto power over major transactions into what they called the Public Interest Foundation. And this foundation has 11 seats on its board. Three belong to Yandex. And the other eight are divided up among influential business groups and state-affiliated universities. And this structure now has that veto power that used to be with Sberbank. It seems like the Kremlin's policy towards Yandex varies a lot. Sometimes it's really concerned about foreign influence. Sometimes it just sort of lets it go. Why is there this inconsistency? So we've been speaking so far about the Kremlin as this sort of single entity. But to understand power in Russia, you need to understand more than just the Kremlin. The authorities are actually made up of these various rival groups. And there's a specific constituency that's known in Russian as the . These are officials with ties to law enforcement. These are basically hardliners who are very protective of the regime and they aim to control all facets of society. Including the internet, which in recent years as conflict with the West has renewed, it\u2019s become one of these arenas they very much wanted to control. And Yandex for its part as this major tech company\u00a0 in Russia has gotten caught up in the middle of that process. And this is something I actually talked about with Tatiana Stanovaya, who is the founder of Russian political analysis site R.Politik. From her perspective, she says that for the , the Yandex foundation was seen as a half-victory. Tatiana says that the Public Interest Foundation has three main functions. The first is to block deals that would concentrate more than 10% of Yandex\u2019s stock under a single owner. The second is to control operations involving intellectual property. And third, and this is another sensitive subject for the So where we are today is that Russia is talking about much tighter constraints on the internet. Talk to us a bit about what's been happening there. So in recent years, Russia has passed two key laws that have affected internet companies. The first one requires them to store data on servers in Russia and not anywhere abroad. And the second law is this notorious, so-called Sovereign Internet Law. This means that a state owned communications infrastructure would be created, that would allow the country to cut itself off from the global internet. What this means is that there would be a sort of a bubble of sorts of Russian own services that would create an internet that would only be Russian. And from the Kremlin's perspective, what it sees through the sovereign internet would be a way to control what its citizens can see online. So it sounds like Russia is going for something much closer to China\u2019s model of the internet, where tech platforms can really only operate if they\u2019re friendly to the government? Yes and no simultaneously. So yes, in that it's attempting to, but one of the main things in recent years has been the fact that a lot of these ventures haven't really succeeded. One of the key moments in the past few years was when Russia tried to block a popular messenger app here called Telegram. And for about a year, it stated that that app was blocked. All the while, authorities kept using it themselves, including state media channels and even the Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov used it himself to communicate with foreign journalists. So it became the sort of farcical, absurdist thing where the country said this technological service was blocked\u2014but it wasn't able to block it. And a year and a half later, it just announced \u201cyou know what? It's no longer blocked.\u201d So with the sovereign internet it does remain to be seen whether this is something that Russia is actually able to pull off. And so while it may want to be China in this sort of way, it sometimes falls short. What would it mean for a company like Yandex if the Sovereign Internet Law really goes fully into effect? It would be massive. Yandex has been hoping to expand its business beyond Russia's borders for a long time. It hasn't been incredibly successful at that, but there are some ways that it's been you know, reaching out beyond Russia recently. Its driverless car program has been piloted in Detroit and in Las Vegas and in Israel. The more Russia tries to cut off from the global internet, the more that would hamper a company like Yandex\u2014which is hoping to be not just Russian, but global. So this at one level seems like a very specifically Russian story. There's this big company. It dominates practically every area of its industry. It's in this cozy, but tense relationship with the Kremlin. It's had to make some concessions. And yet at the end of your piece, you argue that this relationship with the government is something that Western tech companies might have to start emulating. Right. Even, you know, companies like Google and Facebook have started coming under pressure namely for what's seen as their opaque content moderation processes. And this year, Facebook, in response to that, created this so-called oversight board. It's similar to how Yandex\u2019s Public Interest Foundation has universities and big companies that are part of it. Facebook's oversight board has legal and human rights luminaries who are able to review and overturn some of the platform's decisions. So this is sort of like a small scale version of what Yandex's Public Interest Foundation is. And it may sort of foretell you know not just the sorts of demands that a company like Google and Facebook may face going forward, but the solutions that they might come up with to retain some sort of independence in the way that Yandex has here in Russia.

{"text": "Moscow\u2019s operatives did not invent our crude tribal politics; they just exploited them. Ms. Hill was senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council from 2017 to 2019. Robert O\u2019Brien, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, that he had recently met his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, in Geneva and warned him that \u201cthere would be absolutely no tolerance for any interference\u201d in the November election. This was a pointless exchange. It misrepresents how Russia actually interferes in our affairs. The Russian state does not meddle directly. It delegates to proxies, who amplify our divisions and exploit our political polarization. And the truth is, Americans must recognize that the United States is ripe for manipulation. With a month to go before Election Day, we are ripping ourselves apart. When I was at the National Security Council, I had similar meetings with Mr. Patrushev and other Russian officials; we met in Geneva, in Moscow and in side rooms at international summits. With the national security advisers H.R. McMaster and John Bolton, we called them out for intervening in our 2016 elections. We warned them not to repeat their operations in 2018 and 2020. Our Russian counterparts never admitted to anything. They professed surprise at the uproar in American politics. They had done nothing. The United States, they said, had \u201cgone mad.\u201d The uproar, we countered, was their fault. They had lost the entire American political class. Their actions pushed our bilateral relationship into a destructive spiral. We would then run through the now widely reported facts about what Russian operatives had done. Russia\u2019s 2016 campaign was a creative mix of old-style propaganda techniques and new cybertools. On the one hand, Russia state-backed media outlets magnified the most divisive U.S. political conflicts. On the other, Twitter bots and WikiLeaks spread disinformation and revealed hacked emails. Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency analyzed U.S. public opinion and hired individuals to pose as Americans on Facebook. how could these actions \u2014 hypothetical, of course possibly have had such an impact? Apart from the use of cyberhacks and social media, what we were describing was a textbook \u201cactive measures\u201d operation. Everyone used to do this in the Cold War. What was the big deal? Was the United States really so vulnerable? Could America be so fractured and fragile that one \u201cbad election\u201d would plunge it into political chaos? In fact, the United States was vulnerable in 2016. The Russian operation was sophisticated and audacious, but it took advantage of our mistakes and what Americans did to fellow Americans. Russian operatives did not invent our crude tribal politics; they invented internet personas to whip them up. American politicians reduced the country to red and blue states; Russian operatives purchased online ads to target voters on both sides of the domestic divide. American commentators pinned vitriolic labels on our national leaders; Russian bots spread the offensive comments around. I stressed in one side meeting that the Russian security services had taken things to a new level of dirty tricks. Their \u201chack and release\u201d of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s emails and efforts to penetrate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails were especially damaging. With an arch of the eyebrow, the Russian interlocutor pointed out that no Russian persuaded Mrs. Clinton to use a private server. She and the Democratic National Committee made themselves vulnerable to hackers by not taking proper precautions. He reminded me that it was the F.B.I. that reopened the investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails just before the election, because they were on Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer when he was arrested. \u201cWe didn\u2019t invent Anthony Weiner,\u201d he retorted. He brushed off my further protests and objections at his cynicism. \u201cPerhaps you should direct your complaints elsewhere.\u201d Moscow, like everyone else, expected Mrs. Clinton to win in 2016. Russian operatives wanted to weaken her, but they were surprised \u2014 and delighted \u2014 when she lost. They were even more delighted when many Americans exaggerated their role in the outcome. Some of my own foreign policy colleagues suggested the Russians had changed opinions on a mass scale as well as affected votes on the margins. American politicians and commentators declared President Trump illegitimate. They said Vladimir Putin \u201celected\u201d him. Truth is, the idea that Russia determined the election is overstated. It would never have resonated so loudly without our deep polarization \u2014 and our structural issues, including the vast discrepancy between the popular vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton and the narrow Electoral College win for Mr. Trump. These issues were rooted in our system and had already played out in 2000. By overplaying Russia\u2019s ability to influence the vote, American politicians and pundits conceded victory to Russia and its intelligence agencies. Instead, we should have focused on fixing our own faults. Today, we are even more fractured than in 2016. What was then a vulnerability is now a full-blown national security crisis. Our partisan strife has contributed to the botched handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has eroded our international reputation. It has made us susceptible to manipulation by any foreign or nonstate actor that wants to weaken us. Our own political actors are undermining our democracy in a gambit to sway the election. The United States has set international standards for free and fair elections for decades. But President Trump, not President Putin, has repeatedly declared our electoral system \u201crigged\u201d and questioned the integrity of the ballot. As I came to realize while I was at the National Security Council, working directly with colleagues from the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies, the structure of our electoral system is complex and decentralized. Since 2016, the federal government has worked with state and local government officials as well as tech companies to harden our critical infrastructure. Early voting, online voting, in-person voting and paper and mail-in ballots all increase physical election security. If there is full voter turnout, and every vote is counted in every form, then it is much more difficult for anyone \u2014 domestic or foreign \u2014 to mess with the margins. If we want to restore our democracy, we need to heal our divisions and get out the vote. The biggest risk to this election is not the Russians, it\u2019s us. Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at Brookings, was deputy assistant to the president and senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council from 2017 to 2019. "},

His fellow surfer, Natalia Danilova, said in Friday that she was diagnosed with a chemical burn to her cornea after spending time in the water in the bay. Danilova said she had been surfing in the area since August, but three weeks ago she started to struggle with her vision. Others in her surfing group had similar symptoms, while some were also throwing up and complained of breathing problems, she added. Authorities had not posted any warnings in the area and there had been no official explanation as to what might have caused it, she said. NBC News has not been able to verify her claims.

ING bank's unit in Poland allegedly helped its clients move huge amounts of money out of Russia. Russian oligarchs need means to get their cash out of the country, but this has seemingly expanded beyond the Baltics. The Polish unit of the Dutch bank ING, ING Bank Slaski, for years allegedly helped Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs move huge sums of money out of ex-Soviet Union countries, according to the US Treasury's fraud investigation department, FinCen. were leaked to and published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), BuzzFeed, and 110 journalists from 88 countries, including Russian money has since the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991 sought safe investment havens in the West such as\u00a0in Swiss banks, , and French yachts. With a deeply politicized legal process at home, and the tax office often used as a political wing of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, it is hardly surprising that those who made fortunes during the \"wild 1990s\" would not want to keep their cash in Russia. The question has always been how to get it out. We know that Denmark's biggest bank, Danske, via its Estonian subsidiary, allegedly laundered \u20ac200 billion ($235 billion) of illicit Russian cash between 2007 and 2015. , CEO of Hermitage Capital and a former client of the deceased Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, claimed that Danske was involved in a giant scam uncovered by Magnitsky. There would be more revelations to come, he said back in 2018, noting three other banks in the Baltic states that were very likely conduits for stolen Russian money. But at the time, in 2018, the role of banks in Poland was not on the radar. \"It is unlikely that criminals operate on a large scale only in the Baltic States, but not in Poland for some reason,\"\u00a0Louise Shelley from George Mason University, an expert on money laundering, financing of organized crime and terrorism, told DW. \"This is a problem of the whole region. The procedure is not concentrated only in a few selected countries. Criminals look for loopholes everywhere,\" she adds. \"Poland is not the new frontier, it simply got into the news headlines with this case,\"\u00a0Anastasia Nesvetailova, director of the City Political Economy Research Centre in London, told DW. Traditionally, bank structures in the Baltic states have been used to launder financial flows out of Russia, with some new territories \u2014 Abkhazia, Ossetia, Moldova, Armenia \u2014 being earmarked as the \"new frontier\u00a0for Russia\u2019s use of offshore.\" Increasingly, crypto-currencies are being used to launder finance, and not just in Russia,\u00a0Nesvetailova says. Among the criminal organizations laundering the ING money was Altaf Khanani's network, who worked for the Colombian and Mexican cartels as well as for Al-Qaeda and Hezbollah. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( ) estimates that money laundering amounts to between 2-5% of global GDP annually \u2014 $800 billion (\u20ac740 billion) to $2 trillion. \"Insiders have long known that the financial system is awash with trillions of dollars in dirty money,\"\u00a0Linda A. Lacewell, the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, wrote in an op-ed for the ICIJ, adding that solving the problem is stymied by the fact that regulating the system is based on self-reporting. Two Dutch securities traders, Tristane Capital and Schildershoven Finance, were allegedly key players in the movement of billions of euros out of Russia. The two companies were European counterparties of the so-called Moscow Mirror Network. Schildershoven bought securities for two companies, Cypriot Serbenta and British Ergoinvest, which in turn laundered Russian rubles. Their bank of choice was ING Bank Slaski. Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs and people from the Kremlin's inner circle were the two Dutch traders' main clients. For example, Igor Putin, a cousin of the Russian president\u00a0and a member of the authorities of several Russian banks was reportedly involved. The scheme worked via parallel and instantaneous purchases and sales of the same number and value of securities. Purchases were paid for in eastern European currencies and sales in western currencies. But both buyers and sellers were part of the same company. According to reports from FinCen, a UK-registered firm, Ergoinvest, played a key role, in 2014 seeing $307 million transferred into its account from Schildershoven's account at ING Bank Slaski. Ergoinvest was a shell company registered in Potters Bar in the UK. There were reportedly at least 140 other companies listed in FinCen reports registered under the same address. In 2014 alone, Schildershoven's operations at the bank amounted to $1.2 billion. In 2018, ING reached an out-of-court settlement with the Dutch authorities totalling \u20ac775m because of its lax approach to money laundering. indicate that ING Bank Slaski could have been used in a similar way in 2013 and 2014. At that time, Schildershoven was its client. The FinCen warned in its reports about suspicious transactions that passed through its accounts. The last suspicious operation that has a record for took place in 2016. The FinCen files revealed that virtually all major global banks have been involved in money laundering Tristane Capital and Schildershoven Finance moved from using to ING Bank Slaski in 2013. Deutsche's role dates back to 2011, when its turnover began to drop in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. In a 2018 interview with Reuters news agency, the officers of the New York-based regulator Department of Financial Services (DFS) said Deutsche Bank had been turning a blind eye to suspicious transactions because its management was \"blinded by greed and a desire for illegal enrichment.\"\u00a0In 2017, Deutsche Bank was forced to pay $630 million in penalties imposed by UK and US financial regulators. \"ING is one of the many big banks, including Deutsche, Danske, Raiffeissen, many private banks\u00a0in the West and some subsidiaries of banking giants which had been enabling money laundering out of post-Soviet space,\"\u00a0says Nesvetailova. \"ING hit the headline this year, Danske last year, Deutsche a few years back, and we can expect more such revelations to come out.\" Between 2014 and 2016, after the invasion of the Crimea and the outbreak of conflict in the east of Ukraine, the country\u00a0faced the largest banking crisis in its history. Almost half of its banks went bankrupt and their clients lost over $20 billion. Kyiv turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help. Under strict conditions, the IMF agreed to allocate $17.5 billion to help over four years. It suspended the aid in 2017 after disbursing only half over worries about corruption. But by then at least $1.8 billion of this had been deposited with , one of Ukraine's largest banks, owned at the time by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, who backs the current president Hong Kong's flagship airline says the \"devastating impact\" of the pandemic means it has to slash 8,500 positions. Faced with ever more complex regulations, a debate has started of who should be making decisions. Critics argue Chancellor Angela Merkel and the State premiers are bypassing parliament in their bid to fight the pandemic. German police say they have arrested a man suspected of carrying out a knife attack in Dresden two weeks ago. No motive has been given for the attack, in which one man was fatally injured and another severely wounded. Finnish researchers say their canine sniffer experts can detect COVID-19 quickly and cheaply but, so far, their skills are hardly used to control the pandemic.

{"text": "With an eye to a possible Biden presidency, the Russian leader called for a \u201creboot\u201d on information security but offered no concessions. MOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday proposed a truce with the United States in cyberspace, without acknowledging that his country has repeatedly used cybertechniques to attack elections from the Ukraine to the United States, stolen emails from the Defense Department to the White House, and developed some of the world\u2019s most sophisticated disinformation efforts. outlining a four-point plan for what he called a \u201creboot\u201d in the relationship between the United States and Russia in the field of information security. Moscow and Washington, he wrote, should issue \u201cguarantees of nonintervention into the internal affairs of each other, including into electoral processes.\u201d He urged a bilateral agreement \u201con preventing incidents in the information space,\u201d modeled on Cold War-era arms control treaties. But beyond the conciliatory language, Mr. Putin\u2019s statement offered no hint that Moscow was prepared to make any specific concessions on its greatly accelerated use of cyberweapons over the past decade \u2014 sometimes directly, sometimes through proxies. Russia continues to deny interfering in American politics, while insisting that the United States meddles in Russian politics by backing opponents of Mr. Putin. \u201cAs we have said more than once, there is no basis\u201d for claims that Russia has meddled in American elections, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Friday. \u201cWe are in favor of a professional and constructive discussion of all existing problems and claims at the negotiating table.\u201d President Trump has said repeatedly that he is tempted to believe Mr. Putin\u2019s insistence that Russia had no role in the 2016 election, although the spokesman for the National Security Council, John Ullyot, dismissed Mr. Putin\u2019s offer on Friday. \u201cIt is hard to take such statements seriously when Russia, China, Iran and others have sought to undermine our election process,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ullyot said, following Mr. Trump in suggesting the problem goes beyond Russia. \u201cIt is possible that this offer is a further effort by Russia to create divisions in the United States,\u2019\u2019 he said. Russia has floated similar proposals before, including when Mr. Putin met with President Trump in Helsinki, Finland, in 2018. Mr. Trump warmed to them at first, saying he would work with Russia to create \u201can impenetrable cybersecurity unit\u201d designed to assure \u201cthat election hacking, and many other negative things, will be guarded and safe.\u201d But Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration was mocked by many, including some members of the president\u2019s own staff, who asked how the United States would jointly patrol cyberspace with one of the world\u2019s leaders in cyberespionage. At around the same time, the United States was placing malware inside Russia\u2019s electric grid , in hopes of deterring Moscow from attacking the American grid. It was not clear if Mr. Putin was calling for the reset because of the intense focus on Russian activity around the 2020 election, or because firms attacks, some from groups linked to the military and Russian intelligence agencies. This time, Mr. Putin is calling for a reset less than six weeks before an American presidential election that could put an outspoken critic of the Kremlin \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 in the White House. The move appeared at least in part to be an attempt to present a friendlier face in response to American officials\u2019 recent statements that Russia had mounted clandestine efforts to weaken Mr. Biden in the presidential race. Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., warned last week against Mr. Biden. That led to a rebuke of Mr. Wray from Mr. Trump. And a recent C.I.A. analysis that it was likely Mr. Putin was continuing to approve and direct operations aimed at raising Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election chances. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that in the Kremlin they understand that Biden is likely to win,\u201d said Andrei Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a research organization close to the Russian government. \u201cThey are preparing for a Democratic administration that could be even tougher toward Russia than a Republican one.\u201d Both Russia and China have periodically proposed cybersecurity treaties, including requirements that everyone logging into the internet be required to use their true identity. While such proposals might limit illicit activity \u2014 if they could be enforced \u2014 they would also make it easier for the world\u2019s autocrats to hunt down dissidents. Most academic experts have concluded that the treaties that led to arms reductions from the 1960s forward were unlikely to work in cyberspace. were in the hands of a small number of states; cyberweapons are controlled by countries, criminal groups, activists and teenagers. Often, states conduct their cyberactivities through proxies, including criminal groups. All those would make treaties fairly useless. Nonetheless Mr. Putin seemed enthralled by the idea. \u201cThese measures are aimed at building up trust between our States, promoting security and prosperity of our peoples,\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s statement said. \u201cThey will significantly contribute to ensuring global peace in the information space.\u201d Two Russian political analysts with ties to the Kremlin said in interviews Friday that even if Mr. Putin\u2019s proposal was a genuine attempt at improving the relationship with Washington, they did not expect it to go anywhere. Mr. Kortunov said Mr. Putin had not signaled that he was ready to give any substantial ground in the dispute over election interference. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the Kremlin would, of course, prefer not to quarrel with Washington, no matter the election result,\u201d Mr. Kortunov said, noting the risk of a President Biden seeking to impose new sanctions on Russia. \u201cBut they would like to avoid these challenges without paying a serious price.\u201d For instance, Mr. Kortunov noted, the Kremlin has not made any public effort to rein in , the Russian business magnate indicted by the United States for helping spearhead interference in the 2016 election. On the contrary, Russia\u2019s relationship with the West has only deteriorated further in recent weeks. The , the Russian opposition leader now recovering in Berlin, stirred revulsion in European countries including Germany and France \u2014 places where Mr. Putin had been able to count on some measure of sympathy. And Mr. Putin\u2019s , the Belarusian autocrat who launched a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters last month, demonstrated the Kremlin\u2019s hard-line pursuit of a post-Soviet sphere of influence at the expense of human rights. Fyodor Lukyanov, a Moscow foreign-policy analyst who advises the Kremlin, said Friday\u2019s cybersecurity proposal underscored that Mr. Putin is now in a far more conciliatory mood than he was at the height of the Ukraine crisis five years ago. But he said American distrust of Russia was so deep that he did not expect Mr. Putin\u2019s proposal to be taken seriously in Washington \u2014 and that relations could take another step downward if Mr. Biden wins the presidency. Anton Troianovski reported from Moscow, and David E. Sanger from Washington. "},
{"text": "Russia\u2019s tightening embrace of embattled Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is raising concerns at NATO that the balance of military power in the alliance\u2019s weak northeast corner could tip further in the Kremlin\u2019s favor. Western capitals have lambasted Mr. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 26 years, for declaring himself last month and cracking down on street protests. The U.S., U.K. and Canada are preparing sanctions. The European Union is Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, is using Belarus\u2019s crisis to press Mr. Lukashenko\u2014who has long tried to use the EU as a hedge against \u2014to accede to Russian demands for greater sway, which have long included putting military bases on Belarusian territory. That could position Russian forces as a pincer on either side of the 60-mile Polish-Lithuanian border, which is the only land route between the Baltic states and the rest of North Atlantic Treaty Organization territory. Dubbed the Suwalki Gap after the small Polish city in its middle, it is seen as the alliance\u2019s weak\u00a0point. \u201cSuwalki is much less of a concern if you don\u2019t have Russian troops in Belarus,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commander of U.S. Army Europe.\u00a0\u201cIf you do, it\u2019s a different calculation in terms of the time, speed and power they\u00a0can bring.\u201d \u201cIt would dramatically change the calculations we have for the defense of the Baltics,\u201d said a Lithuanian defense official. Belarus as a Russian buffer \u201cgives us breathing space of a few days, which are vital.\u201d The protests against Mr. Lukashenko show no signs of dwindling despite the brutal police crackdown. The West has shown little of the support it did for Ukraine\u2019s opposition in 2014, which eventually forced out a pro-Russian leader, sparking Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and covert invasion of eastern Ukraine. Since then, NATO has focused on increasing defense and deterrence on its eastern flank, primarily by stationing four multinational battalions totaling some 4,000 troops in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland. NATO strategists worry about the Suwalki Gap because Russia\u2019s military superiority in the region means it could seek quickly to cut the Baltics off from allied reinforcements by land. \u201cSecuring the Suwalki Gap is regularly tested in allied exercises, and free movement of NATO forces within allied territory is an important part of our defense posture,\u201d said NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu. NATO\u2019s presence in the region is aimed at preventing conflict, she said, and the alliance \u201cremains vigilant, defensive and prepared to deter any aggression against allies.\u201d Russia has also bolstered its military might in the region, particularly . Its amphibious landing exercises from the Baltic Sea caused alarm earlier this year among Baltic states and prompted Sweden, a partner of NATO but not a member, to boost its military presence on its island of Gotland. Russia has denied any aggressive intent and accuses NATO of massing forces on Russia\u2019s border. The West had sought in recent years quietly to bolster the ability of Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s government to resist Russia\u2019s pressure for tighter integration. Belarus held joint training with 28 U.K. marines in March, but Mr. Lukashenko has since blamed NATO and Belarus\u2019s neighbors for his domestic problems, suggesting they are trying to overthrow him. The deterioration in ties between Minsk and the West has coincided with Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s efforts to bolster his relations with Moscow, the only regional player whom the Belarus leader sees as a guarantor of his continued rule. Numerous calls have been made between Messrs. Putin and Lukashenko and the Belarus leader \u201cAll these events have shown us that we need to have closer ties with our elder brother and cooperate on all issues,\u201d Mr. Lukashenko said ahead of talks with Mr. Putin in Sochi. The Kremlin has long craved more control over Belarus, where it already dominates the economy through gas and oil supplies and loans. After Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine, to Belarus\u2019s south, Mr. Lukashenko fended off Russian requests for an air force base on Belarusian territory. Mr. Lukashenko has also worked to slow Russian efforts to integrate the two countries\u2019 militaries, intelligence services and economies. \u201cLukashenko doesn\u2019t have the space he had before for maneuver and Russia\u2019s leverage over him is now higher than ever before,\u201d said Fyodor Lukyanov, head of a Kremlin advisory board on defense and foreign policy. Moscow, however, is aware of the danger of clinching too many agreements with a leader who has been rejected by his own people. After its experience in Ukraine, where Moscow saw popular support in that country turn against the Kremlin, Mr. Putin is careful not to swing sentiment against Russia and toward the West. On the military front, Russia is already working toward greater cooperation. Bilateral military exercises that were planned before the August elections started earlier this month, with live-fire drills and paratrooper landings with 1,000 Russian troops. Those exercises, called Slavic Brotherhood 2020, ended on Sept. 25, but Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has suggested more drills in October. NATO countries are also flexing their muscles. Around 500 U.S. troops arrived in Lithuania this month, with armored vehicles including tanks for a near two-month deployment that includes live-fire exercises. The U.S. Army said it was a routine exercise and \u201cis evidence of the strong and unremitting U.S. commitment to NATO and Europe.\u201d NATO\u2019s defense plan relies on quickly reinforcing Europe in case of an attack. The U.S. had hoped to practice such an operation this year, in a large military exercise that had been set to involve 37,000 service members across Europe but was Gen. Hodges, the former U.S. Army Europe commander, said Moscow may feel emboldened by squabbles and delays over Western sanctions on Belarus and questions over the U.S. commitment to Europe caused by plans to reduce U.S. troop numbers. \u201cThe cohesion of NATO and the EU, the unmistakable U.S. commitment to Europe\u2014that\u2019s why Russia hasn\u2019t attacked,\u201d he said. When that is less evident, \u201cthe risk goes up,\u201d he said. Copyright \u00a92020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

{"text": "While many countries face a real problem of violent radicalization, others use the imaginary threat of it to construct their domestic and foreign politics. by the Russian TV channel NTV on September 2nd, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that \u201c200 trained Ukrainian radicals are involved in the events in Belarus\u201d. He did not specify who are these \u2018radicals\u2019, who trained them and what for, why are they there, and what makes them the \u2018radicals\u2019. These questions were neither important for him nor for the Russian audience. What was important is Lavrov's message that the unlawful forces from Ukraine are involved in the events in Belarus on the opposition side. This was the main goal of the Foreign Minister's reference to \u2018radicals\u2019 in his speech, which demonstrated the biased usage and understanding of the term by Russian officials. Since its re-appearance in the political discourse in the early 1990s, the term \u2018radical\u2019 gradually became a buzzword that today goes hand in hand with two others: extremism and terrorism. The vague legal definition and the carefully drawn image that attaches the term \u2018radical\u2019 to violence and unlawfulness made it very convenient to refer to it while fighting the opponents of the regime. On the one hand, the lack of a precise definition rendered it possible to interpret any action or dissent as \u2018radical\u2019 by the law. This is widely used in Russia and some other authoritarian countries, where people sometimes are being sentenced to serve several years in jails even for \u2018liking\u2019 some posts on . On the other hand, the reference to it helps to create an atmosphere of fear and justify new and harsh measures of control. This, in turn, contributes to the regime's survival. These advantages of using the term \u2018radical\u2019 in political discourse did not become obvious for the Russian political elite in the early 1990s, when radicalization was making its way to becoming a global trend. The search for a handy explanation that can justify unpopular actions in foreign and domestic politics by the Russian government started with the Russo-Chechen confrontation in 1994. At that time, those to be later identified as \u2018radicals\u2019 had very little to do with radicalism. Indeed, no one would interpret the pro-independence movement in Chechnya as radical. On the contrary, it was rather normal in the context of the Soviet Union\u2019s disintegration in 1991. The term \u2018radical\u2019 evokes sufficiently strong negative emotions that allow mobilizing the population\u2019s support Separatism, at that time, did not bear any negative connotation and would not justify the hawkish policy. The portrayal of the pro-independence regime in Chechnya as unlawful was a better bid but did not scare the Russian population enough to support the of 1994-1996. It took the Russian elite more time to saddle and ride on the global trends through labeling Chechen pro-independence movement as \u2018Wahabbis/Islamists/Salafists\u2019 synonymizing the terms with \u2018radical Islamism\u2019 and \u2018terrorism\u2019. The participation of volunteers from Arab countries in the Chechen wars was helpful for such labeling and increased popular support for the governmental policies from the general Russian public. The success in the usage of this term inspired a further elaboration. The terms \u2018radical Islamism\u2019 or \u2018terrorism\u2019 had a rather narrow application (mostly regarding the Chechen case), which was not satisfactory for a country with multidimensional domestic and foreign politics such as Russia. The suppression of the autocratic regime\u2019s opponents and its politics of \u2018the near abroad\u2019 oriented towards the republics that broke away from the Soviet Union needed a more convincing justification than the fight with the imaginary threat of terrorism. The term \u2018extremism\u2019, which was more inclusive, still could not satisfy the growing need for more universal justification. Detaching the Islamist component from the already colloquial \u2018radical Islamism\u2019 appeared to be a good idea. The term \u2018radical\u2019 evokes sufficiently strong negative emotions that allow mobilizing the population\u2019s support. At the same time, it is not as frightening as \u2018terrorism\u2019 and \u2018radical Islamism\u2019, which gives the government an easier time reconstructing public opinion about the \u2018radicals\u2019. Moreover, it gives flexibility in applying the law, measuring the sentence in line with the political necessity. Those, labelled \u2018radicals\u2019, can be sentenced as \u2018terrorists\u2019, \u2018extremists\u2019, or just \u2018hooligans\u2019. This universality of the term has made it very popular in the Russian political discourse since the beginning of the second decade of the new millennium. It became widely used in Russian domestic politics handling liberal protest movements and arresting their leaders. Furthermore, its demand in foreign politics grew immensely since Ukraine\u2019s political turn towards the West and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Moreover, as Lavrov's speech demonstrates, the term proved to be useful in the Belarussian dimension of Russian politics too. This article is published under a .

{"text": "(Bloomberg) --Lukoil PJSC is seeking to develop new oilfield projects in Iraq even as slumping crude prices and OPEC+ supply cuts have compelled the company to slash production in the country. Russia\u2019s second-biggest oil producer pumped 400,000 barrels a day last year at its West Qurna 2 project in southern Iraq, and it had planned to boost output there in 2020. Instead, Lukoil has reined in production to 280,000 barrels a day to help Iraq comply with its quota under the global supply-cuts agreement, said Egor Zubarev, managing director of the company\u2019s Middle Eastern business. While it expects for now to keep output levels unchanged, Lukoil will \u201csoon\u201d submit proposals to Iraqi authorities to develop a separate area in the south known as Block 10, Zubarev said in an email. Oil prices are 36% lower this year since the coronavirus gutted fuel demand, and Lukoil, like other producers, has had to postpone its immediate plans to raise output. Iraq, OPEC\u2019s second-largest producer, ordered international companies working at its fields to pump less oil after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia agreed in April to take nearly a 10th of the world\u2019s supply off the market. \u201cThe current situation forces us and our partners to revise our plans to see how they correspond to the needs of the time,\u201d Zubarev said. Still, Iraq is \u201cundoubtedly\u201d one of Lukoil\u2019s \u201cprioritized regions,\u201d he said. Lukoil has a 75% stake in West Qurna 2 and is working on projects to explore other parts of the field as well as the separate Block 10 area. Iraq\u2019s financial constraints present a challenge. Lower crude prices are putting pressure on the government\u2019s budget, and some oil projects have slowed due to Baghdad\u2019s shortage of cash, Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar said Tuesday in an online conference. When the country is ready once again to ramp up production, it will need upgraded export facilities and pipelines, according to Zubarav. Iraq\u2019s current output is limited to about 3.6 million barrels a day, under the OPEC+ deal. It has long targeted production of 5 million barrels daily, with a capacity to export about the same amount.

{"text": "Country will be giving 10m doses of Sputnik V a month by December, says head of fund backing vaccine or Kirill Dmitriev, the man in charge of selling Russia\u2019s coronavirus vaccine to the world, there\u2019s a simple rationale behind Moscow\u2019s accelerated push to be the first country to roll out a coronavirus vaccine for widespread use. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the Russian mentality to save the world,\u201d said Dmitriev, head of Russia\u2019s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, in an interview with the Guardian. Others see things rather differently. After the that the Russian vaccine had \u201cpassed all necessary tests\u201d, there was a chorus of unease from scientists around the world. that no scientific data had been made public from early trials, and phase three trials of the vaccine had not even started. that Russian hackers had stolen secrets from medical institutions in the west. Dmitriev dismissed the criticism and allegations as a \u201cconcerted effort to tarnish the Russian vaccine for political reasons\u201d. What is clear is that the vaccine race has become another front in the standoff between Russia and the west. It is no accident that Russia has named its vaccine Sputnik V, harking back to the Soviet satellite sent into orbit in 1957 amid fierce competition with the US. For , providing the first solution to a pandemic that has affected every corner of the world would be seen as a confirmation that the country\u2019s scientific brains are still among the world\u2019s best. \u201cIt\u2019s like the space race half a century later. If indeed it\u2019s a success story and Russia is the first country to come up with an efficient vaccine then of course it\u2019s a major PR opportunity,\u201d said Andrey Kortunov, who runs the Russian International Affairs Council in Moscow. But first, Russia has to prove that Sputnik V, produced by the Gamaleya, part of the country\u2019s ministry of health, actually works. In early September, Gamaleya scientists of phase one and two trials in the Lancet, and a phase three trial is now under way, which should involve 40,000 volunteers being vaccinated in the coming weeks. Even at this early stage, however, the government is pushing ahead with ambitious plans for a broad rollout across the country and beyond. While there is clearly one eye on global glory, producing a successful vaccine will also be welcome at home, given Russia has recorded the fourth-highest number of Covid cases in the world. A second wave is well under way, with the number of new cases rising dramatically in recent days. On Monday, Putin appealed to Russians to take \u201cmaximum responsibility\u201d for their behaviour and try to minimise the Covid risks. \u201cWe are already vaccinating high-risk groups in different regions of Russia, and we will go to about 10m doses a month in December,\u201d said Dmitriev, estimating that within seven to nine months, the majority of Russians will have been vaccinated. While the doses for Russians will be produced inside the country, Russia hopes to license production to a number of other countries, including India, and Dmitriev estimated that capacity could be 500m doses a year by next year. These numbers may be wildly unrealistic, but the confidence with which they are stated underlines the fact that Russian authorities have placed a huge bet on the vaccine being a success story. Numerous vaccines are in advanced clinical trials across the world, but the Gamaleya vaccine is the only one that already has large-scale rollout plans. The vaccine uses two human adenoviruses engineered with a coronavirus gene, and comes in two shots taken 21 days apart. On Wednesday, Russia\u2019s consumer safety watchdog said the Vector institute in Siberia had completed clinical trials of a second potential vaccine. Gamaleya scientists believe that immunity from its double-shot vaccine should last for two years, though Dmitriev conceded that \u201conly time will tell\u201d. Some of the critics of the speed of the rollout have said that while the vaccine itself may be safe, if it offers minimal or only brief immune responses it may have a counterproductive effect and lower confidence in vaccines in general. Other scientists have been more positive. \u201cThe risks associated with this class of vaccine are not great, and I think it\u2019s likely they will provide a level of immunity that\u2019s useful,\u201d said Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading. Numerous top Russian officials took the vaccine over the summer, even before it had been approved for use, as did one of Putin\u2019s daughters. \u201cI had a temperature for one day, took some paracetamol, and then I was fine. Now I can see that I have antibodies,\u201d said one member of the Russian political elite who was vaccinated back in June. . One official said the issue had become \u201cso politicised\u201d it was better not to talk about it or raise potential risks in official meetings. It is not just Russia that has seen vaccine development as a race. In Tuesday\u2019s , Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to rush through a vaccine. \u201cHe puts pressure, and disagrees with his own scientists,\u201d said Joe Biden, in response to Trump saying a vaccine would be ready \u201cvery soon\u201d. A moment of truth for the Russian vaccine will be the results of the phase three trials. According to the ministry of health, as of last Friday 3,500 people had taken part in the trial, and all 40,000 should have received their first shot by the end of October. One quarter of participants will receive a placebo, to compare Covid infection rates among the two groups. Participants in the trial will have to upload health data into an app for a six-month period. Officials say the trial is oversubscribed, but there are signs that not everyone is participating voluntarily. One employee of a Moscow government department described pressure at work to sign up. \u201cIt was made clear that we had to sign up online for the trial. When they called to tell me to come for an appointment, I had to make up an excuse as to why I couldn\u2019t,\u201d said the employee. A journalist for the Russian outlet Meduza, who volunteered for the vaccine, reported that when she arrived at the vaccination point a man was complaining he had been forced to attend. The ministry of health and Gamaleya declined to answer questions from the Guardian, initially promising an interview but then offering instead a short written response to questions, stating that the vaccine \u201chas proved its safety and efficiency\u201d. Russia is so confident that Sputnik V will be successful that it will not seek full indemnity from purchasers, leaving the state open to huge compensation claims if major side-effects are discovered later. Dmitriev claimed he had already received provisional orders for more than 1.2bn doses of the vaccine for the next year from more than 50 countries. \u201cThe west will unfortunately, for political reasons, continue to paint it black and undermine, and that is just the unfortunate reality of the world,\u201d he said.

{"text": "The disclosure appeared to be aimed at helping President Trump benefit politically, and intelligence agencies were said to object to its release. WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s top intelligence official on Tuesday released unverified information about the 2016 campaign that appeared to be a bid to help Mr. Trump politically and was said to be disclosed over the objections of career intelligence officials who were concerned that the material could be Russian disinformation. were the latest by John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence and previously an outspoken congressional ally of the president, that highlighted information that helped Mr. Trump but that critics have called distortions. Mr. Ratcliffe sought to shore up the credibility of the material, which centered on claims about Hillary Clinton, saying that it was not a product of Russian disinformation after initially acknowledging that it could be. But his initial disclosure, coming hours before the first , offered fresh ammunition for Mr. Trump to attack his political enemies. In a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Ratcliffe laid out snippets of previously classified reports suggesting that Russian intelligence had acquired information that Mrs. Clinton had approved a plan for her 2016 campaign to \u201cstir up a scandal\u201d against Mr. Trump by tying him to the Russian hackers who had broken into Democratic servers. Other officials \u2014 including Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel appointed by the Justice Department, and the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 had evaluated and rejected the information in the years since, according to three current and former officials familiar with those inquiries. An official familiar with the committee\u2019s work said that Mr. Ratcliffe and Mr. Graham released it over the objections of other intelligence officials. \u201cIt\u2019s very disturbing to me that 35 days before an election, a director of national intelligence would release unverified\u201d rumors that originated from Russia, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He helped lead an exhaustive bipartisan investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign that between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials. Mr. Warner said he had never seen anything like the letter on Tuesday from another director of national intelligence. Mr. Ratcliffe conducted a classified briefing on Tuesday evening for Mr. Graham about the sources behind the declassified intelligence he had released, according to people familiar with the matter. The last-minute briefing included no Democratic lawmakers; staff members for Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and the ranking member of Mr. Graham\u2019s committee, were blocked from attending, a deviation from normal practice for intelligence briefings on Capitol Hill. The impromptu briefing angered Democrats. Mr. Ratcliffe had promised to brief on the sources, but some congressional officials were surprised by the hasty meeting. They suggested that the scheduling reflected the need to brief Mr. Graham before congressional testimony by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey on Wednesday. Democrats called the releases one of the starkest examples of politicization of the intelligence agencies under Mr. Trump. While Mr. Ratcliffe \u2014 a former congressman from Texas with little intelligence experience \u2014 promised during his Senate confirmation hearing to be nonpartisan, since taking the job he has over what career officials say is a greater threat from Russia and made other declassifications similarly beneficial to the president. \u201cRatcliffe is abusing his position exactly as I feared he would, and the abuse is accelerating as we near the election,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said in a statement. The letter on Tuesday was the first time Mr. Ratcliffe had released material dismissed by other officials as unverified rumor. He initially embraced that assessment, saying that \u201cthe Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.\u201d The intelligence agencies have stopped short of definitively assessing the material as disinformation. But in a statement hours after the release of the letter, Mr. Ratcliffe appeared to caveat his own warning. \u201cTo be clear, this is not Russian disinformation and has not been assessed as such by the intelligence community,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be briefing Congress on the sensitive sources and methods by which it was obtained in the coming days.\u201d The snippets of information that he released included an intelligence report sent to Mr. Comey on Sept. 7, 2016, and handwritten notes by the C.I.A. director at the time, John O. Brennan, that said he had briefed President Barack Obama on the information. A spokesman for Mr. Brennan said the release amounted to \u201cblatant politicization.\u201d \u201cRussian interference in the election was real, intense and unprecedented in scale and scope. It was authorized personally by Putin to hurt Secretary Clinton and to promote the electoral prospects of Donald Trump,\u201d said Nick Shapiro, Mr. Brennan\u2019s former deputy chief of staff at the C.I.A., referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. \u201cThe intelligence on this is incontrovertible and the analysis unimpeachable.\u201d Mr. Brennan was presenting a huge array of information about Russia to the White House in the summer of 2016. Including the information about what Russian intelligence was saying about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plans was not an endorsement of its accuracy, but a demonstration of how much information the United States was collecting on Moscow, a former intelligence official said. Other officials say they believe that the intelligence could simply be Russia\u2019s analysis of American politics, suggesting not a plot by the Clinton campaign to manufacture a scandal but a legitimate political critique of the Trump campaign\u2019s stance toward Russia. Officials said the timing was not a coincidence, pointing not only to the debate but also to Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony on Wednesday before Mr. Graham\u2019s committee, which is scrutinizing the bureau\u2019s Russia investigation that the president has long sought to falsely portray as a plot to undermine him. Mr. Graham brushed aside concerns about the veracity and provenance of the information. \u201cI\u2019m not saying whether it\u2019s true or not,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m asking Democrats, do you give a damn whether the F.B.I. investigated, or do you only care about investigating Trump?\u201d He added that it was \u201cnot far-fetched to believe the Clinton campaign would do something like this.\u201d As the election approaches, administration officials have been declassifying an array of material aimed at raising questions about the investigations of the 2016 campaign. The disclosures have mainly appeared to be aimed at energizing Mr. Trump\u2019s political base and fueling conspiracy theories that the national security establishment has been trying to stymie his presidency. Last week, Attorney General William P. Barr provided Mr. Graham with that tried to further cast doubt on aspects of the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia\u2019s investigation. Former F.B.I. and Justice Department officials said the selective declassification appeared to be part of a pattern of politically motivated steps by Mr. Barr to bolster Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations about the inquiry. Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, seized on Mr. Ratcliffe\u2019s disclosure, that it showed that Mrs. Clinton was behind what he called \u201cthe Russia Hoax.\u201d "},

The Cardinal board had previously backed the Shandong bid, which has received a tick of approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board. Nordgold's offer is not due to close until November 3 and it is determined to take control of the Namdini project, which is near some of its existing operations in Africa. Nordgold chief executive Nikolai Zelenski said it was \"fully committed to successfully closing its offer and to the future success of the Namdini project\". \"We are Cardinal\u2019s largest shareholder and this revision represents the third price increase that Nordgold has made, while conversely Shandong has announced that it will not be increasing its price further,\" he said in a statement.

(AFP) MOSCOW, RUSSIA -- \n\tRussia hosted the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan for separate talks this week as world powers seek to step up hitherto failed efforts to agree a lasting truce to halt fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov and his Armenian counterpart Zohrab Mnatsakanyan for separate talks on Tuesday and Wednesday, Lavrov's ministry said in a statement. But the two ministers from the Caucasus rivals had no face-to-face encounter in the Russian capital. Russia, the United States and other world powers are seeking to step up efforts to persuade both sides to stop fighting that has left hundreds of people dead after two purported ceasefire accords never showed the slightest sign of holding. The ministers visited Moscow ahead of meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday. A trilateral meeting in Washington has also been ruled out and they will meet Pompeo separately. In Russia, the chief diplomats discussed \"urgent matters related to the implementation of agreements to halt fire and creating conditions for a lasting settlement\" of the Karabakh conflict, the statement said. Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said only that its top diplomat had travelled to Moscow \"for consultations\". Armenian foreign ministry spokeswoman Anna Nagdalyan said Mnatsakanyan met Lavrov on Wednesday. A truce was agreed in Moscow earlier this month after 11 hours of talks, but the accord had next to no impact on the ground. A second ceasefire agreed Saturday fell apart almost immediately. Yerevan says 772 Armenian soldiers and 36 civilians have been killed in the flare-up of fighting. Baku has reported 63 civilian casualties but has yet to disclose military losses. Azerbaijan and the Armenian separatists who control its Karabakh region have been locked in a bitter impasse over the fate of the mountainous province since a war in the 1990s that left 30,000 people dead. Their long-simmering conflict erupted again on September 27 in fierce clashes that raised the alarm over the failure of decades-long international mediation. Along with France and Russia, the United States co-chairs the so-called Minsk Group of international mediators to the Karabakh peace talks since the 1994 ceasefire. Baku says its forces have captured ground within Karabakh and that it also now controls other Azerbaijani territory that had been held by Armenian forces. Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has said there can only be a ceasefire when Aremenia pulls out from Karabakh and all the surrounding regions of Azerbaijan held by Armenian forces. However Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has urged international recognition of Karabakh, claiming its inhabitants would not be safe under Azerbaijani rule.

{"text": "As U.S. authorities guard against dirty tricks from foreign adversaries in the run-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election, an unlikely source has come under new scrutiny as a major conduit of Russian-linked disinformation: a Montreal-based website run by a retired University of Ottawa professor. The platform,\u00a0Global Research,\u00a0features a Canadian domain name and offers an\u00a0ever-expanding collection of conspiracy theories, such as the myth that the 9/11 attacks and COVID-19 pandemic were both planned in order to control the population. The website also hosts articles experts have attributed to a Russian spy agency. With more than 275,000 Facebook followers and a potential readership in excess of 350,000 per article, the U.S. State Department has identified the site as having the single-biggest reach among \"Kremlin-aligned\" disinformation sites. \"This is part of a larger effort to sow disarray and distrust within Western democracies,\" said James Andrew Lewis, a senior researcher at the Washington, D.C.-based think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. U.S. intelligence agencies found Russian state actors mounted a multi-faceted assault before the 2016 U.S. election\u00a0in an effort to undermine the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and bolster Donald Trump's odds of winning. They say the operation involved spreading false claims and amplifying divisive debates within American society online. Russia was \"so successful\u00a0in\u00a02016, I'm sure they'll try the same thing again in 2020,\" Lewis said, \"and this website is part of that effort.\" Michel Chossudovsky, the University of Ottawa professor emeritus of economics who runs the site, told CBC News through a lawyer that his platform is not a Russian-aligned disinformation site and urged a reporter not to embark on a \"witch hunt.\" In an\u00a0email, the lawyer also said his client would not agree to an interview. The FBI has identified such proxy\u00a0sites as one of the main tools used by Russia this year to sow discord and denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. a congressional committee in September that the agency has again observed \"very active efforts\" by Russia to affect the election through \"malign foreign influence,\" including the use of social media, state media and proxies. Experts say the Canadian-based website fits into the broad network used by Russia to attain its objectives, but also say it is unknown whether there is any co-ordination with Moscow. Since 2001, Global Research has acted as the online component of the Centre for Research on Globalization, a self-styled \"independent research and media organization\" run by Chossudovsky. Along with more than 40 \"research associates\" and writers, the website lists a post office box within a convenience store as its mailing address, just down the street from Montreal City Hall. Chossudovsky, a frequent guest on the Russian state TV network RT, serves as the site's editor and is one of its main contributors. He has regularly questioned the seriousness of COVID-19, recently labelling it a \"manufactured pandemic.\" Russia and China as drivers of coronavirus conspiracy theories. One of Global Research's articles, featuring the unsubstantiated claim that the virus first came from a U.S. source, was in March by a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman and later deleted. Marcus Kolga, founder of the website , said platforms like Global Research give outlandish narratives \"an air of legitimacy that they wouldn't otherwise have,\" what's known as \"information laundering.\" On Tuesday, for example, Global Research posted a piece underscoring Joe Biden's unproven \"cognitive decline.\" The same article also warned of \"the imminent danger of a Kamala Harris presidency,\" suggesting that\u00a0as a prosecutor,\u00a0she disproportionately jailed\u00a0Black men because of a vendetta against her Jamaican-American father. The website has also\u00a0published articles sympathetic to the Russian-backed regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other pieces critical of\u00a0NATO, the Western alliance that has sought to contain Moscow's aggression. in 2017 that Global Research had become the target of an investigation by NATO's information warfare specialists, who suspected the site was playing a role in amplifying Russian-aligned narratives with little basis in fact. This year, a U.S. State Department identified Global Research as being part of a network of proxy sites that,\u00a0while having no visible ties to Moscow, \"serve no other purpose but to push pro-Kremlin content.\" \"It provides plausible deniability for Kremlin officials when proxy sites peddle blatant and dangerous disinformation, allowing them to deflect criticism while still introducing pernicious information,\" reads the report, published by the State Department's anti-foreign propaganda arm, the Global Engagement Center. Based on analysis of web traffic on seven such sites\u00a0from February to April of this year, the report pointed to the Canadian-based platform as the Kremlin-aligned disinformation site with the biggest potential audience. \"At more than 350,000 potential readers per article, no other outlet had half as much reach as Global Research,\" it said. Kolga, who is also a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, an Ottawa-based\u00a0think-tank, said it's hard to contain disinformation once it's posted on such websites\u00a0and then shared by users on social media \u2014 especially on less regulated message boards such as 4Chan and in groups of What's more, Kolga\u00a0said, is that when the main voice of a disinformation website is tied to a respected university, \"it makes it believable. That is the problem here.\" Chossudovsky's CV says he joined the University of Ottawa's economics department in 1968 and was promoted to the rank of full professor in 1979. In 2001, the faculty of social sciences granted him its Excellence in Teaching for \"outstanding performance.\" The university's website still Two other U of O professors, Marcel M\u00e9rette and Yazid Dissou, who appear alongside Chossudovsky in a 2014 picture on his website, said they weren't aware the photo was being used in that way until a CBC reporter brought it to their attention. Both sought to distance themselves from Chossudovsky. M\u00e9rette, currently the university's deputy provost, said he does \"not endorse or support the views and opinions expressed by the former professor Chossudovsky on the website or in any other medium.\" Dissou, an economics professor, similarly said he doesn't want to be associated with Chossudovsky's \"activities or ideas,\" calling him a \"former colleague who retired from the department more than six years ago.\" Chossudovsky's website also features photos of him in discussion with the late Cuban communist leader Fidel Castro.\u00a0Chossudovsky's CV notes he holds Canadian, British and Irish citizenships and that he's been interviewed on such mainstream news outlets as CBC, CTV and BBC. In 2005, Jewish advocacy organization B'nai Brith complained to the university after the group became aware of Holocaust denial material on Chossudovsky's website. \"We remain concerned that the website still promotes conspiracy theories, including anti-Semitic ones,\" B'nai Brith Canada\u00a0CEO\u00a0Michael Mostyn\u00a0said in an email to CBC. He pointed to a range of wild claims on the site, including the unfounded allegations that Israel worked with the U.S. to intentionally unleash COVID-19 and that Israel and Jewish-American politicians staged the 9/11 attacks. Chossudovsky declined\u00a0to answer emailed questions from CBC about his links to Russia and the source of his website's funding. Instead, his Montreal-based lawyer, John Philpot, told CBC\u00a0that Chossudovsky \"pursues legitimate journalism as he has done for almost 20 years.\" Philpot\u00a0also said, \"please (do) not embark on the type of witch hunt which has become common practice south of the border.\" Research from Stanford University's Internet Observatory, a program examining abuse in information technologies, found links tying Global Research to Russian military intelligence agency operations. The , commissioned by a U.S. Senate intelligence committee, analyzed online content that Facebook attributed to the spy agency commonly known as the GRU. Based on the research, the State Department said\u00a0Global Research published or reposted articles by at least seven authors using aliases \u2014 or \"sock puppet personas,\" according to the Stanford report \u2014\u00a0to hide their ties to the GRU. The content remains accessible on the website. According to a U.S. Justice Department indictment , six alleged officers from the same agency were charged in the U.S. for an array of cyberattacks around the world. The GRU was also linked to a hack of Democratic Party emails in 2016. In an interview, Stanford research scholar Shelby Grossman said the team looked for evidence that disinformation stemming from the spy agency wound up in the mainstream press. \"It didn't really succeed,\" she said,\u00a0as\u00a0the articles\u00a0were only published on fringe sites such as Global Research. She said the content was more likely to reach audiences who already tended to believe in conspiracy theories and \"weird, Russian-aligned views.\" \"That being said... this is still dangerous,\" she said. \"This kind of content can further polarize people to hold incorrect beliefs.\" While in CBC's London, U.K. bureau, Thomas reported on everything from the Royal Family and European politics to terrorism.

{"text": "Russia\u2019s top arms-control negotiator has rejected the Trump administration\u2019s core requirements for a new nuclear arms-control treaty, dealing a blow to the White House\u2019s hopes of concluding an election-year framework agreement with Moscow. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told The Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration\u2019s demands that a future treaty cover all Russia, Chinese and U.S. warheads and include more-intrusive verification is \u201cclearly a nonstarter for us.\u201d if the U.S. allows the New START treaty, a nuclear arms-reduction agreement that entered into force in 2011, to lapse and moves to expand its nuclear arsenal. \u201cWe would be ready to counter this,\u201d he said. The Trump administration has built its negotiating strategy on the premise that Moscow is eager to avoid an intensification of the arms race with the U.S., which has a larger military budget than Russia and at a cost of more than $1 trillion. In August, U.S. officials urged their Russian counterparts to agree on a framework accord that would spell out the terms of a future treaty that would limit all nuclear warheads, including those on Russia\u2019s short-range nuclear systems, impose stringent monitoring measures and cover In return, the U.S. would give Russia : A temporary extension of the New START treaty, which cuts long-range nuclear arms and is due to expire in February. In a blunt signal to the Kremlin that time was running out to strike such a deal, Marshall Billingslea, the top U.S. negotiator, told the Russian newspaper Kommersant in September that the administration would stiffen its demands for extending New START if Moscow dragged its feet in the talks. \u201cIf Russia does not accept our offer before the elections, the entry price will go up,\u201d Mr. Billingslea told the publication, according to an English translation of his interview. With five weeks left until the Nov. 3 vote, Mr. Ryabkov delivered his response Tuesday in a telephone interview from Moscow. \u201cWe are not going to buy this extension of the New START at any price, especially not at the price which the U.S. wants us to pay,\u201d he said. \u201cI think our positions are currently very far apart.\u201d U.S. officials had no immediate comment on Mr. Ryabkov\u2019s comments. A U.S. official said that the administration is in the early stages of discussing possible steps to expand U.S. nuclear forces as outlined by Mr. Billingslea in the Kommersant interview. Mr. Ryabkov said that it is reasonable to ask China, Britain and France if they want to join a new arms-control arrangement, but that the U.S. and Russia should be prepared to work on their own agreement. China has said repeatedly that it doesn\u2019t want to join an arms accord. \u201cWe know pretty well the positions of Beijing, Paris and London,\u201d Mr. Ryabkov said. \u201cThey are not particularly interested in this. So the second-best option would be that we continue our dialogue on a bilateral basis\u201d while the New START treaty is extended. He added that the \u201csensible verification procedures\u201d that were negotiated for New START should be relied on to monitor nuclear limits instead of the more-stringent measures Mr. Billingslea has demanded for a future accord. While the U.S. has insisted that a new agreement limit Russia\u2019s substantial force of short-range nuclear weapons, which aren\u2019t covered by the New START treaty, Mr. Ryabkov argued the U.S. should remove its own \u201cnonstrategic capabilities from Europe,\u201d . Such a move has long been deemed to be out of the question for Washington. As negotiators on both sides dig in their heels, progress before the U.S. election is unlikely unless Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump talk in coming weeks, former American officials say. Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has said that and use it as a foundation for working out other arms-control arrangements. \u201cRussia has very little incentive to negotiate on U.S. terms this close to an election,\u201d said Pranay Vaddi, a former State Department official and an arms-control expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThe only way for this current dynamic to change is for the heads of state to engage directly because their top negotiators are at an impasse.\u201d Seeking to increase his negotiating leverage with Moscow in the coming weeks, Mr. Billingslea has signaled that if Mr. Trump is re-elected and the talks remain stalemated,\u00a0 the U.S. would allow the New START treaty to expire and then move to expand its nuclear forces. To stay within the limits of the New START treaty, on each of its Trident II submarines and converted some B-52H bombers to a nonnuclear role. But Mr. Billingslea told Kommersant that the U.S. would carry out a \u201creverse conversion of our weapons immediately after expiration of the treaty in February.\u201d Such steps also could include installing two additional warheads on many of the Air Force\u2019s 400 Minuteman III missiles, which currently carry a single warhead. Such an expansion could increase the U.S. long-range nuclear force by more than 1,000 warheads, . The U.S. is limited to 1,550 warheads under the New START treaty. It would also mark a significant shift in U.S. targeting policy. In 2019, Gen. John Hyten, who at the time was leading the U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees nuclear weapons, and is now vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that if the New START treaty were to expire it was \u201cunlikely to drive significant changes in U.S. force structure.\u201d Mr. Ryabkov said that how Moscow might respond to such a development was still an open question. \u201cThere are different ways, both symmetrical and asymmetrical, how to counter it,\u201d he said.

Overall, the results reveal ample scope for growth in Russia\u2019s gold investment market:\u00a0investors are positive towards gold. Most investors believe gold offers security and holds long-term value as a hedge against currency and inflation fluctuations. However, it\u00a0is not currently considered a mainstream investment among Russians, though the WGC found there is a significant conversion opportunity. More than half of the respondents say they would consider doing so, despite never having invested in it previously. The WGC study also reveals a need for more information around gold investing in Russia. Education is needed around the affordability of gold, how to buy it and the factors that drive the gold price. Russian investors also need to feel more confident over the purity and veracity of the gold products on offer, and they need greater trust in the businesses selling them. Established, reliable vendors, and rigorous assaying standards and trading practices may help to assuage these fears, the Council says. "},
{"text": "When Rimvydas Valatka signed up to a new cable TV package recently he was surprised to see \u2014 alongside the usual news, sports and sitcoms \u2014 at least six stations that broadcast in Russian. Around the same time, Valatka, an analyst and a signatory of the act that secured Lithuania\u2019s independence in 1991, made another observation. Russia Today (RT), Moscow's now-ubiquitous television network, That amounts to a lot of muscle for the Kremlin in Lithuania, a country that was under Soviet rule until 1991. , but it's not been effective, Valatka said. \u201cAlthough [RT] has been banned by Lithuania for the dissemination of propaganda and enmity, it is still omnipresent on the cable TV channels and on the internet,\u201d he told Euronews. According to Lithuania\u2019s State Security Department (VSD), RT is just one of a number of soft power weapons that Moscow uses to get its narrative across in the Baltic state. More broadly, the media is a prime vessel for promoting Russia\u2019s language, culture and history in Lithuania. Since Lithuania gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the Baltic state has embraced Europe, joining the European Union and the NATO alliance in 2004. In 2015, it joined the euro currency, the last of the Baltic states to do so after Estonia, in 2011 and Latvia, in 2014. But despite the country\u2019s fractious history with Russia, which forcibly absorbed it in the wake of World War II, there are forces within Lithuania who want to see it foster its ties with Moscow, often at the expense of its relationship with the European Union. There remain at least two Russia-friendly parties in Lithuania, the Electoral Action of Poles (LRA) - made up from Lithuanians who are ethnic Poles - and the Russian Alliance. There are also individual MPs in the Lithuanian parliament who are Russian-friendly. This division has been exposed most recently over events in Belarus, with which Lithuania shares a border. Lithuania was the first European state to condemn the elections that saw Russia-backed President Alexander Lukashenko re-elected on August 9 in the face of vote-rigging and violence against opposition figures. While largely well-received in Lithuania, the stance of Vilnius to Belarus angered the LRA\u2019s Zbigniew Jedzi\u0144ski, who said that the Belarussian security forces that cracked down on protesters on the streets of Minsk and other cities were \u201cdefending [the country\u2019s] constitution.\u201d Valdemar Tomashevski, LRA chairman and MEP, has also criticised Lithuania\u2019s leaders for its support of the Belarussian opposition. \u201cBelarus has chosen revolution, not evolution,\u201d Tomashevski said. This pro-Belarus \u2014 and, through it, pro-Russian \u2014 line has found itself amplified through the Russian dominated media, said Arvydas Anusauskas, a Lithuanian parliamentarian and a member of the Lithuanian Parliament Committee of Security and National Defence (NSGK). He also blames a motley crew of pro-Russian organisation operating in Lithuania under the umbrella of the Russian Embassy in Lithuania. \u201cAll of them dutifully support the historic narrative being foisted by the Kremlin: that it is Russia that has liberated everybody, and the views reflecting all the major events in the world \u2014 be it the clampdown on the Belarusian opposition, the war in Ukraine or any event in any country worldwide \u2014 come under the Russian influence,\u201d Anusauskas said. He added that pro-Russian sentiment \u2014 at least in Lithuanian politics \u2014 has tapered off since the war in Ukraine, which saw Moscow annex the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. \u201cIn its wake, many Lithuanian municipalities that had cherished their ties with Russian administrative units severed them and/or reassessed them,\u201d Anusauskas said. It is little surprise, then, that since 2014 Russian influence in Lithuania has taken the form of so-called \u201csoft power\u201d rather than an attempt to actively interfere in politics in the country. As well as the growth of Russian-language media, the battle for influence between east and west has recently manifested itself in basketball in a spat over whether Baltic teams should take part in Russia\u2019s professional basketball league, the VTB. One of the 13 teams taking part in the 2020-21 season is Kalev, from Estonia, and Lithuania\u2019s main club, Zalgiris, also recently mulled joining the Russian league. \u201cHad the club accepted the offer it would have become, perhaps unbeknownst to it itself, part of the Russia propaganda machine,\u201d pondered Valatka. Russia also remains one of Lithuania\u2019s key export partners, according to data from Statistics Lithuania, released in September. In the first half of 2020, Russia was responsible for 13.6% of Lithuania\u2019s exports \u2014 the largest of any other country \u2014 and 9.6% of imports. Given such links, Russian soft power in a smaller nation like Lithuania is perhaps to be expected, said Gediminas Grina, former director of Lithuania\u2019s State Security Department. \u201cBoth politics and culture, as well as sports, media and leisure activities serve the purpose and are enmeshed endlessly. Speaking of Russia, it is hardly an exception in terms of influencing smaller neighbours at the borders. However, some countries are hostile and some are not.\u201d As Lithuania is a democratic country, he said, it is hard to root out manifestations of soft power. \u201cLook, with any constraint being enforced, we will start hearing it constitutes a breach of human rights. This is how the democratic world is. And, frankly, walking the line is a very delicate matter,\u201d Grina said. \u201cAt the end of the day everything boils down to the consciousness of the individual \u2013 how he or she perceives things and, yes, threats to our national security,\u201d he added. The case of Baltic teams joining Russia\u2019s basketball league is a classic example: Doing so may be a soft power win for Moscow, but at the same time it is a huge financial boon to the clubs. \u201cIn pure terms of sports, our clubs can benefit,\u201d he said. For Valatka, combatting soft power of any form in Lithuania is a long term project, and the only way to win it is through a long-term strategy. He has seen plenty of examples of prominent scientists, teachers, law enforcement figures and others taking the Moscow line on social media, often without realising what they are doing. \u201cThe only weaponry we have in the fight is intellectual \u2013 raising free, conscientious, critically-minded and financially-free citizens.\u201d "},
{"text": "The assessment, which the agency has moderate confidence in, buttresses earlier findings that the Russian president supports President Trump\u2019s re-election. is most likely continuing to approve and direct operations aimed at raising President Trump\u2019s re-election chances, a recent C.I.A. analysis concluded, a signal that intelligence agencies continue to back their assessment of Russian activities despite the president\u2019s attacks. on Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker who has spread information critical of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. It is consistent with to lawmakers in January that Russia was interfering on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, a briefing that outraged Republicans and eventually helped oust Joseph Maguire from his post as acting director of national intelligence. The C.I.A. has moderate confidence in its analysis, a lower degree of certainty than its 2016 assessment of Mr. Putin\u2019s preferences, in part because the intelligence community appears to lack intercepted communications or other direct evidence confirming his direction of Mr. Derkach\u2019s efforts. Mr. Putin, a former intelligence agent, is careful not to use electronic devices. According to people familiar with the matter, the new analysis was published ahead of the sanctions in the C.I.A. Worldwide Intelligence Review, a classified document that circulates to members of Congress and the Trump administration. The Washington Post Mr. Putin\u2019s direction, national security officials have said, should be of little surprise. Russia has become an authoritarian country under him, and little in its foreign affairs occurs without his knowledge or blessing, American officials have repeatedly said. Russian efforts to influence American politics have continued steadily since 2016, even if the volume of disinformation has ebbed and flowed. But the C.I.A.\u2019s lower level of confidence in the new assessment allows Mr. Trump and his allies to treat the allegations of Mr. Putin\u2019s involvement as unproven. For years, many Republicans have taken issue with the C.I.A. analysis of Russian interference. John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, who was an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump while a member of Congress, and other Republicans have argued that Mr. Putin\u2019s goal is to sow chaos, not to favor one candidate over another. And Mr. Trump himself remains hostile to arguments that Russia is intervening to support him. After the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, testified last week that Russia was in the United States and \u201cdenigrate Vice President Biden,\u201d Mr. Trump publicly, saying he should have also emphasized China\u2019s election interference efforts. American intelligence officials say that while China opposes Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election, Beijing has not mounted significant covert efforts to hamper the president\u2019s campaign. But intelligence officials said there is little doubt that Mr. Putin is broadly orchestrating Russian campaigns and has continued to allow his intelligence operatives to try to influence American politics. The key questions that American intelligence agencies have not answered are the extent of Russia\u2019s effort and how open Mr. Putin wants to be about it. In a statement in August, William R. Evanina, the intelligence official in charge of election interference briefings, said Russia was trying to . Mr. Evanina cited information released by Mr. Derkach. Mr. Evanina was set to brief members of Congress\u2019s intelligence committees this week. Mr. Ratcliffe had sought to block in-person testimony to Congress, citing leaks. But faced with criticism from Republicans and Democrats, Mr. Ratcliffe modified his position to block only all-member briefings. Some officials have said the recent C.I.A. assessment demonstrates that the agency remains willing to push intelligence that Mr. Trump disagrees with. His administration has also taken action to try to raise awareness of Russian activities. The Treasury Department on Sept. 10 described Mr. Derkach as \u201can active Russian agent\u201d with ties to Moscow\u2019s intelligence services and said he was involved in efforts to influence elections. He released doctored tapes of Mr. Biden that American officials have said were edited to mislead the public. American intelligence agencies have tried to track his efforts to push information critical of Mr. Biden to lobbyists and members of Congress, information that was included in the C.I.A. assessment, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Derkach denies that he works on behalf of Russia. The president has pushed various theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election and has supported efforts to raise questions about the work Mr. Biden\u2019s son did for a Ukrainian energy company, namely led by Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, that Democrats have warned is the target of Russian disinformation. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has criticized Republicans in Congress for investigating his ties to Ukraine and his son\u2019s work for the energy company. On Tuesday, Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesman, said some members of Congress \u201chave chosen to be accessories to foreign influence operations\u201d and attacked Mr. Trump\u2019s Russia policy. \u201cAs Joe Biden has said for months, it is absolutely clear who Vladimir Putin wants to win this election \u2014 because Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been a gift to the Kremlin,\u201d Mr. Bates said. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer who has led the efforts to gather information about Mr. Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine, has taken information from Mr. Derkach. However, the recent C.I.A. analysis did not cite Mr. Giuliani by name, according to a person familiar with the matter. "},

While the WHO\u2019s weekly epidemiological report showed global cases relatively stable for the past three weeks , it says the overall picture hides alarming rises in a number of countries and regions, not least in Europe where the second wave is exceeding previous peaks although some of that is due to increased testing.

{"text": "Turkey\u2019s role in the growing clash between Armenia and Azerbaijan\u2014two countries Moscow regards as within its sphere of influence\u2014is adding a new element to a string of proxy fights pitting Turkey and Russia against each other and challenging Russia\u2019s longstanding policy of neutrality over the simmering conflict. Roughly the size of Delaware, the province of Nagorno-Karabakh\u2014a disputed enclave within Azerbaijan\u2014has been since the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is recognized internationally as part of Azerbaijan but controlled by pro-Armenian rebels. About 30,000 people were killed in fighting over a six-year period before a cease-fire in 1994. But hostilities resumed last week, with each side Russian President Vladimir Putin has long worked to keep former Soviet republics bound tightly to Moscow, and has sought to stay on good terms with both Azerbaijan and Armenia, due to their strategic location along an important energy corridor coveted by the West. Now, a more assertive Turkey is testing that stance. Hours after fighting broke out, Turkey announced its unconditional support for Azerbaijan, with which it shares ethnic and cultural ties. Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated that support on Friday. \u201cAs Turkey, with all our means and with all our heart, we stand with fellow and brother Azerbaijan and we will continue to stand with it,\u201d he said. \u201cGod willing, until Nagorno-Karabakh is liberated from invasion, this struggle will continue.\u201d The scope of Turkey\u2019s support is unclear. France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that he had information that mercenaries from Syria had passed through Turkey to reach Nagorno-Karabakh. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government has denied the claim but its open support for Azerbaijan\u2014the latest example of \u2014is putting Russia on the back foot at a delicate time for Moscow. A pro-democracy movement is threatening to , and a wave of protests in Russia\u2019s Far East is \u201cWe use our privileges to be a welcomed party by both Armenia and Azerbaijan,\u201d said Sergey Markedonov, senior researcher at the government-run Moscow State Institute of International Relations. \u201cTurkey concentrates only on one side and it creates obstacles for Russia, because it pushes Azerbaijan to make a choice.\u201d Moscow, in contrast, has remained studiously neutral over the long-running conflict and has anointed itself mediator. After supplying Armenia with powerful ballistic missiles in the 1990s it then sold Azerbaijan the means to shoot them down through a complex new air-defense system. It also warned other countries to keep out of the fray. \u201cAny statements on military support or military activity unambiguously add fuel to the fire, and we are categorically opposed to this,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters this week. Under Mr. Putin\u2019s leadership, Russia has shown little hesitation to intervene militarily if it feels its dominance over former Soviet republics is challenged.\u00a0It seized territory from both Georgia and Ukraine to counter what the Kremlin said was meddling from the West. Russia has repeatedly warned the European Union and other Western powers to steer clear of the continuing political conflict in Belarus, where Mr. Putin\u2019s ally President Alexander Lukashenko has faced weeks of protests after claiming victory in a presidential election his opponents dismissed as a fraud. It has signaled its support for the regime by stepping up military cooperation with Belarus. Moscow doesn\u2019t \u201clook kindly on other powers, Western powers, trying to engage in the region without Russian participation, Russian consent,\u201d said Chris Miller, co-director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. But Turkey\u2019s support for Azerbaijan, said Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow with the Carnegie Europe think tank, has left Russia on the defensive. \u201cIf they were to try and step in to support the Armenians, they would lose Azerbaijan and they would lose that role [as a mediator],\u201d he said. Turkey is already involved in two proxy conflicts with Russia\u2014in Libya, where it is supporting the internationally recognized government against , Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and in Syria, where Ahmet Kasim Han, a professor at Altinbas University in Istanbul, says Turkey would be loath to open a new front by sending forces to Nagorno-Karabakh. \u201cIt would legitimize Russia sending in more troops,\u201d he said, noting that Moscow already has close military ties with Armenia, and has stationed some 5,000 troops along its border with Turkey. Armenia is also part of a Russian-led mutual defense alliance. Azerbaijan, a far wealthier country than Armenia thanks to its oil reserves, has diversified its arms-supply chain, notably buying drones from Israel, but remains a significant buyer of Russian weaponry. Yet even in pro-Russian Armenia, Moscow\u2019s neutral approach is ruffling feathers. \u201cWe don\u2019t like that Russia as our strategic allied partner is selling [weapons] to our direct enemy,\u201d Armenia\u2019s deputy defense minister Gabriel Balayan said. \u2014Thomas Grove contributed to this article Copyright \u00a92020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

{"text": "Former traffic officer Sergei Torop, AKA Vissarion, arrested in special operation in Siberia Russian authorities mounted a special operation to arrest a former traffic police officer who claims to be the reincarnation of Jesus and has based in the depths of Siberia for the past three decades. Helicopters and armed officers stormed communities run by Sergei Torop, known to his followers as Vissarion, and arrested him and two of his aides. Russia\u2019s investigative committee said it would charge him with organising an illegal religious organisation, alleging that the cult extorted money from followers and subjected them to emotional abuse. Torop, 59, with long grey hair and a beard, was led by masked troops to a helicopter. The operation involved agents from Russia\u2019s FSB security service as well as police and other agencies. Vadim Redkin, a former drummer in a Soviet-era boyband who is known as Vissarion\u2019s right-hand man, was also arrested, along with another aide, Vladimir Vedernikov. Torop, who lost his job as a traffic officer in 1989, claimed he experienced an \u201cawakening\u201d as the Soviet regime began to collapse. In 1991 he founded a movement now known as the Church of the Last Testament. Several thousand followers live in a series of remote hamlets in the Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia. Converts to the cult have included professionals from across as well as pilgrims from abroad. \u201cI am not God. And it is a mistake to see Jesus as God. But I am the living word of God the father. Everything that God wants to say, he says through me,\u201d Vissarion told the Guardian Russian media reported that in the original ideology of the cult, Vissarion claimed Jesus was watching over people from an orbit close to Earth, and the Virgin Mary was \u201crunning Russia\u201d, but later he declared himself to be Jesus. His commune mixes a selection of rites drawn from Orthodox Christianity with environmental edicts and a series of other rules. Veganism is enforced and monetary exchange is banned inside the commune. Followers wear austere clothing and count years starting from 1961, the year of Vissarion\u2019s birth, while Christmas has been replaced by a feast day on 14 January, his birthday. It is not clear what will happen to the disciples now that their leader has been arrested, nor is it clear why authorities decided to move now. The official Russian Orthodox church has the group but officials have largely left the devotees alone. Some Russian media outlets reported that the community had become involved in a dispute with local business interests. "},

This has plunged Moscow\u2019s primary economic and defence alliances into turmoil and raises questions about Russia\u2019s role as the region\u2019s provider of stability. While not directly linked to each other, the crises in Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and Belarus all bear the scars left by the collapse of the Soviet Union, from authoritarianism and threats to electoral freedom to disputed territories and ethnic divisions. Each of the three crises raises distinctive concerns for Russia. The Caucasus conflict has seen Turkey, through its support for Azerbaijan, challenge Moscow\u2019s hegemony in the region, and question the Kremlin\u2019s standing as a supreme arbiter. Mass protests in Belarus \u2014 where popular support for president Alexander Lukashenko snapped in August after 26 years in power \u2014 have led to questions being asked of Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s own reign, months after he changed the constitution to allow him to rule until 2036. And the ongoing attempt to overthrow Kyrgyzstan\u2019s president by opposition parties, following alleged electoral fraud, has demonstrated the inherent challenges of the so-called managed democracy that Mr Putin has deployed in Russia and seen imitated in many post-Soviet countries. \u201cPutin\u2019s neighbourhood is suddenly in flames,\u201d a senior western diplomat in Moscow told the Financial Times. \u201cIt is hard to see how he will handle this all at once.\u201d Camilla Ogunbiyi, principal analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a risk consultancy, said: \u201cDevelopments in Bishkek demonstrate to leaders across the former Soviet Union that once you extend political freedoms, the people are unlikely to give them up willingly. \u201cThe Kyrgyz protests are therefore likely to make Mr Lukashenko dig in further and reject demands for political rights by the Belarusian people. Equally, they will inspire Belarusian protesters to persist,\u201d she added. Russia has so far sought to avoid any direct intervention in the three crises, but cannot afford to allow events to spiral out of control. The country\u2019s foreign ministry on Tuesday said: \u201cRussia is interested in ensuring the internal political stability of Kyrgyzstan \u2014 its strategic partner and ally\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. We call on all political forces at this critical moment for the republic to show wisdom and responsibility in order to preserve internal stability and security.\u201d Moscow has military bases in Armenia, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan and considers itself the pre-eminent foreign partner for each. It has resisted efforts by third parties such as the EU in Belarus and China and the US in Kyrgyzstan to increase their influence. Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia are also three of Moscow\u2019s four partners in the Eurasian Economic Union (the other is Kazakhstan), a Russia-led political, economic and trade alliance. They also belong \u2014 with Russia, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan \u2014 to the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Nato-like military body that includes a mutual defence pact. The Kremlin is also caught between intervening to prop up allies at the risk of provoking public backlash, and leaving neighbouring regimes to their fates, risking possible regional contagion and the suggestion of its own weakness. Footage from Bishkek on Tuesday showing the country\u2019s parliament building flecked with smoke and ransacked by protesters was reminiscent of the White House, Russia\u2019s government headquarters, after the attempted coup against president Boris Yeltsin in 1993 \u2014 a memory of a time of political instability before Mr Putin took power. \u201cAll sides in Kyrgyzstan are broadly committed to strong ties with Russia,\u201d said Livia Paggi, partner at GPW, a political risk consultancy. \u201cThe Kremlin will therefore be willing to allow domestic developments to play out so long as they do not threaten Moscow\u2019s geopolitical alliance.\u201d \u201cThat said,\u201d she added, \u201cthe situation will remain firmly on the Kremlin\u2019s radar given the current heightened level of unrest elsewhere in the post-Soviet space and the potential for further turbulence in the coming month as elections take place in Moldova, Georgia and Tajikistan. The former two are likely to provoke mass protests if contested.\u201d Elections are also set to take place in January in Kazakhstan, a neighbour of Kyrgyzstan. The polls will be the first since Nursultan Nazarbayev stepped aside after 29 years as president in March last year. His decision to vacate the presidency but retain key powers as chairman of the country\u2019s security council has been suggested by some analysts as a potential model for Mr Putin, should he wish to step aside. But Moscow\u2019s unwillingness to help crush opposition to Mr Lukashenko or Mr Jeenbekov \u201cis likely to encourage citizens across the broader CIS region, including in Kazakhstan, as it confirms that the Kremlin is unlikely to overtly and directly throw its weight behind unpopular leaders,\u201d said Ms Ogunbiyi. \u201cInspired by the people of Kyrgyzstan and Belarus, Kazakh activists now present their government with the significant challenge of providing an electoral theatre that signals legitimacy,\u201d she added.

{"text": "Enter News, Quotes, Companies or Videos On any given day over the past two years, visitors to the home page of RealClearPolitics were likely to see its famous average of political polls, a roundup of news and center-right commentary\u2014and, near the bottom, a link or two to stories from RT.com. The provenance of the RT headlines was obscured. Readers didn\u2019t immediately know they were clicking on headlines from a Russian state-backed publication that American intelligence officials considered the Kremlin\u2019s \u201c .\u201d The news organization, once known as Russia Today, was a central player in Russia\u2019s efforts to disrupt the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment of the Russian efforts created a backlash against social-media companies, which were accused of providing platforms for a misinformation campaign aimed at influencing voters. and others have since implemented changes to limit the reach of state-run media. Yet RT continues to draw a large American audience, helped unwittingly by some of America\u2019s most prominent conservative websites. The reason: Those news outlets agreed to join a distribution network that allows other members\u2019 content to be displayed on their home pages. The company responsible for RT\u2019s presence on RealClearPolitics is Mixi.Media. Since its launch in 2018, Mixi has assembled a network of right-leaning publishers, including National Review, The Daily Caller and Newsmax, as well as mainstream sites like RealClearPolitics. Also in Mixi\u2019s fold are RT and another Russian state-backed outlet, Sputnik. The inclusion of state-run media has allowed Russia\u2019s propaganda machine to spread its message across the online news landscape in the U.S. while escaping the attention that came to Facebook and Twitter. While the links that Mixi places on its partners\u2019 websites often appear under headings such as \u201cFrom Our Partners,\u201d the source isn\u2019t always clear until after the headline has been clicked. That is by design. \u201cIf [readers] see RT, they are going to freak out,\u201d said Alex Baron, Mixi\u2019s founder. Mixi has other ties to Russia, though it isn\u2019t clear if they have anything to do with RT\u2019s presence on the network. Mr. Baron is an associate of Russian private-equity magnate Victor Remsha and there are some technical connections between Mixi and properties owned by Mr. Remsha. In interviews with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Baron has said Mixi doesn\u2019t have any ties with Mr. Remsha\u2019s firms and he doesn\u2019t agree with RT\u2019s politics. The 33-year-old, who runs Mixi as a side venture to his day job as a tech director at AccuWeather, said he pursued a partnership with the outlet because he thought it would help Mixi grow. What is clear is the partnership has been fruitful for both. Mixi is the largest source of RT\u2019s \u201creferral traffic\u201d in the U.S., delivering 19% of visitors coming from other websites in July, not including social media, according to web analytics firm SimilarWeb. Mixi is delivering more U.S. traffic to RT than YouTube, Reddit and Drudge Report and, at one point this year, Twitter. July was the last month before some of Mixi\u2019s partners began to drop out of or pull back from the network after being contacted by the Journal for this article. \u201cThis is an information laundering system where you can put RT or Sputnik or whatever inside a panel of legitimate outlets in the U.S., and people don\u2019t realize what they are coming onto,\u201d said Clint Watts, a former special agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute studying social-media influence. \u201cThe attribution is so obscure that you don\u2019t know who the hell it is.\u201d on misinformation and propaganda since 2017. Google\u2019s YouTube added labels to state-run media, including RT, in 2018. Facebook took similar action this June. In August, Twitter started labeling RT and other state-run media and stopped including their content on various recommendation systems, effectively making those tweets harder to find. From the start of 2018 through July, RT\u2019s social-media traffic in the U.S. has dropped 22%, while its overall U.S. traffic has declined 14%, according to SimilarWeb. RT.com had about four million visits in the U.S. in July, according to SimilarWeb. Anna Belkina, RT\u2019s deputy editor in chief, has denounced as \u201cblatantly discriminatory\u201d social-media companies\u2019 moves to label RT and other state media. RT has Some publishers hosting Mixi\u2019s traffic exchange on their websites say they weren\u2019t aware RT was part of Mixi\u2019s network. Following the Journal\u2019s inquiries about Mixi and RT\u2019s inclusion in its network, two of those publishers, The Blaze and 247WallSt, said they removed the Mixi-run section from their sites. Mixi\u2019s Mr. Baron said an additional three\u2014including Newser, NOQ Report and his employer, AccuWeather\u2014also removed Mixi after the Journal\u2019s inquiries. AccuWeather declined to comment on Mr. Baron\u2019s involvement in Mixi. Mixi\u2019s system works like this: When readers click on a Mixi headline, they first land on a \u201ctransit\u201d page on Mixi\u2019s own website. That page will feature another link to the original headline along with headlines from various publishers that Mixi aggregates. Users sometimes click on multiple links on the transit page, boosting traffic for the entire network. Publishers don\u2019t pay to be part of Mixi\u2019s network. Mixi makes money from ads on the transit page. Taboola, a much larger content-recommendation company, also has RT in its network, but Mixi drives a lot more traffic to RT, according to SimilarWeb. Mr. Baron began working for Mr. Remsha, the Russian private-equity magnate, in 2014 at WhoTrades, a New York-based online brokerage firm. The next year, he moved to another of Mr. Remsha\u2019s U.S.-based holdings, a content-recommendation network called Ideal Media Inc. that functioned much like Mixi. Ideal lost money and required additional investment. Around 2017, it was purchased by MGID, another company backed by Mr. Remsha, according to Mr. Baron and other people familiar with the matter. Mr. Baron was fired in March 2018 and accused by Ideal of stealing money, contracts and equipment, according to court documents from litigation that ensued. Lawyers for Mr. Baron, who denied the allegations and said Ideal owed him the money, described Mr. Remsha in court documents as \u201ca Russian oligarch billionaire with ties to Russian President \n\n\n\n\n      Vladimir Putin\n\n\n\n\n      .\u201d Michael Korsunsky, the chief executive officer of MGID\u2019s North American business, called Mr. Baron\u2019s court filing \u201cthe best science fiction of my life.\u201d In June, a judge ruled in favor of Ideal. Mr. Baron said he plans to appeal. Soon after his firing, Mr. Baron began building Mixi. Despite Mr. Baron\u2019s sour exit from Ideal, Mixi maintained various technological links to Mr. Remsha\u2019s firms. At various points since 2018, Mixi shared at least two IP addresses with a news aggregator called smi2, according to a Journal review of data from internet forensics firm Farsight Security Inc. smi2 is partly owned by Mr. Remsha\u2019s investment conglomerate, Finam. Sharing IP addresses\u2014codes that help computers find each other on the internet\u2014suggests websites have overlapping hosting infrastructure, according to Farsight. Mr. Baron initially told the Journal that Mixi didn\u2019t have any links to Mr. Remsha\u2019s firms. After the Journal sent examples of code on Mixi\u2019s site that had been communicating with the servers of Mr. Remsha\u2019s Finam and smi2, Mr. Baron said Mixi removed the code. He said his hosting infrastructure doesn\u2019t overlap with Finam\u2019s and he doesn\u2019t know why the IP addresses would overlap. Mr. Remsha said he wasn\u2019t aware of any ongoing technical connections between Mixi and smi2. He said he isn\u2019t involved in Russian politics, and that he doesn\u2019t believe Mr. Baron is involved in politics either. He added he was \u201cnot so much involved in the process\u201d of the lawsuit against Mr. Baron, although he was aware of it \u201cat a high level.\u201d To launch Mixi, Mr. Baron tried to rebuild a network with many of the same partners as Ideal\u2019s. Several mainstream media outlets didn\u2019t participate. MarketWatch experimented for a few months in 2019 but declined to continue, people familiar with the partnership said. MarketWatch and the Journal are both owned by News Corp. Mr. Baron said he knows RT is the most controversial of his roughly three dozen partners, but that he pursued the publication for years because it is such a big force on the internet. He said he is beginning to regret its place in the network in light of how other partners have responded. \u201cI kind of wish I never went into business with RT,\u201d he said. Some publishers in the network, such as The Daily Caller and AccuWeather, set up Mixi to exclude RT from their feeds. RealClearPolitics, ZeroHedge and Newsmax, three of the top 10 recipients of Mixi\u2019s traffic, have had RT stories appear recently in their content-recommendation sections operated by Mixi. RealClearPolitics Publisher Tom Bevan said his tech team uses many services like Mixi to boost traffic and that he wasn\u2019t aware of RT\u2019s inclusion. Mr. Bevan said RealClearPolitics itself has never linked to a single article from RT. \u201cWe do not have editorial control over all the content in third-party advertising widgets and routinely attempt to block inappropriate advertising content,\u201d he said. The site asked Mixi to stop featuring RT headlines in its recommendation section after the Journal contacted RealClearPolitics, Mr. Baron said. A ZeroHedge spokesman said it doesn\u2019t track content promoted by Mixi or the traffic it provides because it is among \u201ccountless\u201d recommendation partnerships the site uses. Newser didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy said he had \u201cno idea\u201d that Mixi was putting RT stories on his site. Following the Journal\u2019s inquiry, 247WallSt, a financial news and opinion publisher, said it was taking the Mixi section off its site because it was initially unaware that Russia-backed publishers or right-leaning sites like ZeroHedge were among its partners, editor in chief Douglas McIntyre said. \u201cI was very upfront about RT with everyone,\u201d Mr. Baron said, adding that the network delivers more traffic for partners who don\u2019t limit what publications Mixi can promote. \u2014Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.

{"text": "MOSCOW/BISHKEK (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday that Kyrgyzstan had descended into chaos and that Moscow was obliged by a security treaty to prevent a total breakdown in the country, where rival groups have claimed power in post-election unrest. The Central Asian nation, where Russia has an airbase, has been gripped by instability since parliamentary elections on Sunday which government critics and western monitors said were marred by vote-buying. Protesters stormed government buildings on Tuesday and various groups have said they are in charge. Parliament failed to gather a quorum in an overnight session to agree on who should take over from ousted ministers, deputies said earlier on Thursday, prolonging a power vacuum. \u201cThe situation looks like a mess and chaos\u201d, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a briefing, referring to Russian obligations under a security treaty between the two countries to avoid a complete breakdown of government. He did not say what action Russia might take but confirmed that Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia\u2019s FSB security service, had spoken to the new acting security chief of Kyrgysztan, Omurbek Suvanaliyev, on Wednesday. Suvanaliyev, formerly deputy head of the security council, took over when government leaders were driven from power. The committee he now heads issued a statement on Thursday saying Kyrgyz security forces would not be used as a tool by any party and demanding that all political forces negotiate and restore the rule of law. However, the rival factions announced no such plans by the end of the day and their supporters continued to stage rallies. Suvanaliyev also told Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency that Kyrgyzstan was tightening border controls to ensure security and border guards had been given a list of people barred from leaving the country. They included all officials, including those who have resigned, so that no one escapes responsibility, he told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The unrest in Kyrgysztan is the third outbreak of instability in former Soviet republics this year. Mass protests are ongoing in Belarus and fighting has broken out over the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea from another ex-Soviet republic, Ukraine, where a conflict between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists in the east is simmering. In Kyrgyzstan, three opposition groups have each proposed their candidates for interim prime minister, a figure who would need to oversee a repeat vote in the coming months, Kyrgyz news website Akipress quoted deputy Ryskeldi Mombekov as saying. In addition to Sadyr Zhaparov and Tilek Toktogaziyev, who have already made their ambitions clear, Mombekov said Omurbek Babanov, who has already served as the cabinet head, had emerged as a contender. But the outgoing parliament has itself split into two groups that were meeting separately outside the main ransacked government building, Mombekov said. The group that met overnight in a hotel only included 40 MPs, whereas major decisions such as naming a cabinet require a 61-vote majority. Another MP, Elvira Surabaldieva, posted a video from the meeting online, saying it had failed to pass a motion to impeach President Sooronbai Jeenbekov. Jeenbekov\u2019s whereabouts have remained unknown since Tuesday though his spokeswoman told Akipress he has spoken by phone to new parliament speaker Myktybek Abdyldayev and told him he saw his own mission as restoring the rule of law. Kyrgyzstan\u2019s central bank allowed financial institutions to reopen on Thursday after their closure on Tuesday, as business associations warned the nation of 6.5 million could face food shortages if banks and tax offices remained shut and public safety could not be guaranteed. Sunday\u2019s election handed victory to two establishment parties, one of them closely linked to Jeenbekov. Eleven other parties refused to accept the results and the central election commission annulled them on Tuesday as it became clear Jeenbekov was losing his grip on power. One person has been killed and more than a thousand have sought medical help since the unrest broke out, as vigilante units formed by Bishkek residents scuffled with protesters and looters. Some protesters said the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic had fuelled public anger. The foreign ministry of neighbouring Kazakhstan said it was concerned by attacks on several Kazakh-owned companies in Kyrgyzstan and attempts to seize their property, and urged Bishkek to ensure the safety of Kazakh nationals and businesses. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Thursday attended a peacekeeping drill held by the military in the southeastern Almaty province adjacent to Kyrgyzstan. Acting Kyrgyz interior minister Kursan Asanov, who took over this week after running in the election as an opposition candidate, said police and civilians had managed to prevent mass looting in the capital. He vowed to stop any attempts to further destabilise the country where ethnic violence left hundreds dead after the ouster of president Kurmanbek Bakiyev in 2010 in another revolt. Asanov also urged parliament to convene and install a legitimate cabinet, describing the situation as stable but tense.

{"text": "These questions are on the minds of the US intelligence community in the run-up to November's vote. warns foreign powers will use \"covert and overt influence measures\" to try to sway US voters, singling out Russia, China and Iran. The three should not be compounded, as each, in the view of US intelligence, has their own goal and their own capabilities. The assessments themselves are under scrutiny too - he was asked to downplay the threat posed by Russia as it \"made the president look bad\". So with a little over a month to go, what do US voters need to know? As you may have noticed, Russia had a scene-stealing role in the 2016 US election and its aftermath. In short, US intelligence believe Russia tried to sway the vote in favour of Donald Trump, pointing to meetings between his team and Russian officials, a cyber attack against Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democrats, the targeting of state voter databases, and efforts to amplify false or partisan material online. Last month a Republican-led Senate panel gave further support to the view Russia wanted Trump to win, concluding his campaign was an easy target for foreign influence but stopping short of alleging criminal conspiracy. As for 2020, this time swap Hillary Clinton for Joe Biden. In his assessment, intended to be read by the American public, the head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) William Evanina said Russia was \"using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice-President Biden\". In the view of FBI director Christopher Wray, Russia has never stopped meddling, calling efforts in the 2018 congressional elections a \"dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020\". Russia has consistently denied interfering in foreign elections. Earlier this year a Kremlin spokesman called accusations of meddling \"paranoid announcements\" that had \"nothing to do with the truth\". Whether Russia wants a second term for President Trump or not, another view often expressed by analysts is that the country has a broader aim of destabilising rivals by spreading confusion. For example this year an EU document alleged there was to make it harder for the bloc to communicate its response. Russia called the claims unfounded. Joe Biden recently warned there would be a \"price to pay\" if Russia continues to interfere, calling Russia an \"opponent\" of the US. President Trump has frequently downplayed allegations of Russian interference, putting him at odds with his own intelligence experts. After a 2018 summit with Vladimir Putin, asked whether he believed the US intelligence community or the Russian president about the claims Mr Trump said: \"President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be.\" He later said he had misspoken. Prominent voices in the Trump administration have argued that it is China, rather than Russia, that poses the main threat this year. \"I've seen intelligence. That's what I've concluded,\" the Attorney General William Barr said. Democrat Adam Schiff, who chairs the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, accused Mr Barr of \"flat-out lying\" with the comments. In his assessment, Mr Evanina said US intelligence believes \"China prefers that President Trump - whom Beijing sees as unpredictable - does not win re-election\". \"China is expanding its influence efforts to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and counter criticism of China,\" he said. The use of the word \"influence\" is notable. Although China has sophisticated ways to influence opinions - \"content farms, 'astroturf' commenter brigades, and fabricated accounts and personas on social media channels\" how far China is actually prepared to go is unclear. \"China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action,\" said Mr Evanina. The intention may be more to do with promoting China's worldview. Facebook recently shut down a network of China-linked accounts much of which supported the Chinese state, such as its interests in the disputed South China Sea. , saying it is not \"interested or willing to do so\". This month, President Trump approvingly retweeted an article on the Trump leaning Breitbart website entitled \"China seems 'to be favouring Joe Biden' in presidential election\". \"Of course they want Biden. I have taken $Billions from China and given it to our Farmers and U.S. Treasury. China would own the U.S. if Biden & Hunter got in!\" Mr Trump wrote, referring to Joe Biden's son Hunter. US-China ties are at a low ebb, with disputes over everything from the coronavirus to China's imposition of a controversial security law in Hong Kong. Joe Biden has sought to fend off accusations from President Trump he is soft on China, Democrats though argue that when it comes to the election at least, it is Russia that is being most aggressive. In 2016, the US government, as well as social media companies, were slow to confront Russian interference. This time no one is staying quiet but the landscape has changed. Companies are talking loudly about what they are doing and the US intelligence community is publishing regular assessments. But the issue has become deeply politicised. Democrats are focused on Russian interference helping President Trump whilst his supporters have tried to switch attention to Chinese influence working against his re-election. National security officials have tried to walk a fine line - acknowledging both are happening (as well as lower-level Iranian influence) but trying to avoid acknowledging there are differences because of concerns of being drawn into the partisan fight. Russian interference has looked both more organised and covert so far, but not necessarily yet on the same scale or with the same impact as the hack and leak of emails from Democrats in 2016. Tactics have also evolved with those seeking to interference often amplifying genuine, US news and posts rather than making up fake material. And there are worries that more may be coming in the closing stages of the campaign including potentially efforts to undermine the credibility of the electoral process itself. In his statement Mr Evanina says that Tehran is against another term for President Trump, which it believes will result \"in a continuation of US pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change\". Iran's efforts, he says, will focus on \"on-line influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-US content\". Backing up the allegations made by US intelligence, computing giant On Iran, it said an Iranian group known as Phosphorus had unsuccessfully sought to access accounts of White House officials and Mr Trump's campaign staff between May and June of this year. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman called Microsoft's report \"farcical\". \"Iran is not concerned about who will take presidency in the White House,\" said Saeed Khatibzadeh. A report on Iranian influence efforts earlier this year from being focussed on promoting a national agenda, such as its bid for regional supremacy. \"Nearly all content spread by Iran's digital influence efforts relates directly to its worldview or specific foreign policy objectives. Consequently, it is easier to identify the operations of Iran than those of other actors like Russia, whose content is more likely to be politically agnostic,\" it said. Iran has not figured as prominently in the US election as Russia or China, both in terms of its possible influence or in policy. President Trump has pursued an aggressive policy against Iran, withdrawing from the nuclear deal and ordering the killing of the powerful general Qasem Soleimani. Joe Biden says this policy has failed. In an editorial for CNN, he said there was \"a smart way to be tough on Iran\", pledging to push back the country's \"destabilising activities\" while also offering it a \"path to diplomacy\".

{"text": "As part of their attempt to interfere with the 2020 election, Russians are grabbing screenshots of President Trump\u2019s tweets, or quoting his own misleading statements, analysts and officials say. WASHINGTON \u2014 Four years ago, when intelligence agencies engaged in a systematic attempt to influence the American presidential election, the disinformation they fed American voters required some real imagination at the troll farms producing the ads. There was the exaggerated Texas secession movement, a famous ad in which while declaring, \u201cIf I win, Clinton wins,\u201d and an effort to recruit protesters and counterprotesters to the same, invented rally over the rapid spread of Islamic influence in the United States. This year, their task is much easier. They are largely amplifying misleading statements from President Trump, mostly about the dangers of mail-in ballots. In interviews, a range of officials and private analysts said that Mr. Trump was feeding many of the disinformation campaigns they were struggling to halt. And rather than travel the back roads of America searching for divisive issues \u2014 as three from the Internet Research Agency did in 2016 \u2014 they are staying home, grabbing screenshots of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts, or quoting his misleading statements and then amplifying those messages. That campaign is at the heart of the disinformation efforts that the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, was meant \u201cto both sow divisiveness and discord\u201d and \u201cto denigrate\u201d former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. Mr. Trump chastised him for his comments on Twitter. \u201cBut Chris, you don\u2019t see any activity from China, even though it is a FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia,\u201d he said. He went on to repeat the kind of statements the Russians have been exploiting, writing that the two countries would take advantage of \u201cour totally vulnerable Unsolicited (Counterfeit?) Ballot Scam.\u201d Twitter flagged the president\u2019s tweet, urging readers to click on a link to \u201clearn how voting by mail is safe and secure.\u201d The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday again warned of the risk of interference in the election, this time by foreigners aiming to exploit the time it will take to sort through mail-in ballots. During that time, the agencies said, hackers could amplify \u201cdisinformation that includes reports of voter suppression, cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud and other problems intended to convince the public of the elections\u2019 illegitimacy.\u201d The warning made no mention that the president had recently listed several of those techniques as likely to plague the vote. Multiple U.S. officials with access to the intelligence have said Mr. Trump has been doing the job of the Russian propagandists for them. Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser when he was vice president, Antony J. Blinken, charged at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce forum on Tuesday that as a \u201cleading consumer and purveyor of conspiracy theories,\u201d Mr. Trump \u201cseems to have suited up for the other side.\u201d Clint Watts, a former F.B.I. special agent and a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said his review of the disinformation traffic showed that \u201cthe Russians in 2016 had to make false news stories or manipulated truths to power their narratives.\u201d \u201cThis time they\u2019re not writing anything that\u2019s not already said in U.S. space,\u201d often by Mr. Trump himself, Mr. Watts added. \u201cThey must be flabbergasted and saying, \u2018We really don\u2019t need to work hard this time.\u2019\u201d Much of the Russian traffic echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to establish an argument for rejecting the election results if he loses in states that are mailing ballots to all voters for the first time. But of the states doing so for the first time this election, only Nevada is seriously in contention. No sooner did Mr. Trump begin to contend that the system was ridden with fraud than Russian trolls, bots and news sites joined in. In late May, the state-backed Russian website RT was quick to publish an article claiming that such ballots \u201care the easiest route to a RIGGED ELECTION.\u201d By early August, the Strategic Culture Foundation \u2014 an online journal that the State Department declared recently \u201cis directed by Russian Foreign Intelligence Service\u201d \u2014 had , according to analysts at Recorded Future, a group based in Somerville, Mass., that analyzes cyberactivity by foreign governments. An article appearing on the Strategic Culture website concludes: \u201cPresident Trump has several times claimed that the expected surge in mail-in voting could result in \u2018 .\u2019 Trump is often wrong when he speaks or tweets spontaneously, but this time he just might be right.\u201d And this month, the Russian government news site, Sputnik, published an article headlined, \u201cTrump Again Claims Biden May Be Using Drugs to Enhance His Debate Performances,\u201d repeating comments the president made on Fox News. That piece was republished by the right-wing website Infowars, disseminating it more widely in the United States, and readers shared it on social media. That allowed the article to spread without running the risk that it would be removed because it was an \u201cinauthentic\u201d post by a Russian troll in St. Petersburg pretending to be American. The Russia proxy website Newsfront went further, reporting \u201cconfirmation of rumors about Biden\u2019s incapacity.\u201d It is the exact type of disinformation a homeland security intelligence bulletin warned Russian actors have amplified \u201cbecause they judge this narrative will resonate with some American voters and reduce their confidence in him as a candidate.\u201d Feeding the Russian desire to discredit the election system was also what the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee on how Moscow tried to manipulate the 2016 election. \u201cSitting officials and candidates should use the absolute greatest amount of restraint and caution if they are considering calling the validity of an upcoming election into question,\u201d the committee concluded, without dissent from its Republican majority. \u201cSuch a grave allegation can have significant national security and electoral consequences, including limiting the response options of the appropriate authorities, and exacerbating the already damaging messaging efforts of foreign intelligence services.\u201d Now, his own bureaucracy finds itself stuck between their intelligence findings and an angry president. The day before Mr. Trump scolded his F.B.I. director on Twitter, General Paul M. Nakasone, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, warned of the dangers of Russian disinformation \u2014 which his agency has pledged to counter. General Nakasone has vowed to take steps to knock such disinformation offline, as he did in the 2018 midterm elections, when Cyber Command attacked the Internet Research Agency, the digital propaganda shop that operates from St. Petersburg, disabling its systems for a number of days. One veteran of Cyber Command noted that the general\u2019s mission in the next six weeks may involve taking down Russian posts that are quoting his boss. Intelligence officials, for their part, are battling an effort by Mr. Trump and his top advisers to cast China and Iran as equal threats to the election, which runs counter to their intelligence. A homeland security official, Brian Murphy, that the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security, including the agency\u2019s acting secretary Chad F. Wolf, blocked the release of a threat assessment that contained warnings of Russian interference because of how it \u201cwould reflect upon President Trump.\u201d The senior officials instead directed analysts to highlight threats posed by China and Iran, which have generally targeted Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Murphy. While both are threats, officials say, their operations are neither as extensive nor as sophisticated as the Russians. They are longer-term concerns, though Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, has sought to portray them on equal footing with Moscow. Former officials say they are concerned that such contradictory assessments play into Russia\u2019s hands. \u201cIf the adversary\u2019s goal is to undermine confidence in the legitimacy of the process, then it\u2019s incredibly important we have voices to counter that objective,\u201d said Suzanne Spaulding, a former under secretary for cybersecurity and critical infrastructure at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cAnd if the credibility of those voices has been undermined, then it makes the adversary\u2019s jobs that much easier.\u201d In a draft of the assessment from August, homeland security analysts wrote: \u201cRussia probably will be the primary covert influence actor and purveyor of disinformation and misinformation within the homeland.\u201d They continued, \u201cWe assess that Moscow\u2019s primary objective is to increase its global standing and influence by weakening America \u2014 domestically and abroad \u2014 through efforts to sow discord, distract, shape public sentiment and undermine trust in Western democratic institutions and processes.\u201d Mr. Murphy said he learned in September that Mr. Wolf had ordered new drafts to be redesigned by his policy office. Mr. Wolf\u2019s department has now said it will be released on Oct. 1. The Department of Homeland Security has rejected Mr. Murphy\u2019s allegations. Mr. Wolf has seldom highlighted the Russian threat in public remarks without also mentioning China and Iran. Harry Fones, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency had tracked a growing threat from Russia, China and Iran. \u201cAs a department it is our duty to defend our nation and critical infrastructure like elections from all threats, not just the one the news is focusing on,\u201d he said.

{"text": "Injured surfers and large number of dead sea creatures reported in Kamchatka region Water pollution in Russia\u2019s Kamchatka peninsula that caused sea creatures to wash up dead on beaches has prompted fears that rocket fuel stored in the region\u2019s military testing grounds may have leaked. The pollution came to light late last month after surfers reported stinging eyes and said the water had changed colour and developed an odour. Officials later confirmed the surfers had sustained mild burns to their corneas. Then locals reported seeing large numbers of dead marine species including seals, octopuses and sea urchins washed up on a black-sand beach popular with tourists. The regional governor, Vladimir Solodov, said on Monday the sea off the remote Kamchatka peninsula may have been contaminated with toxic chemicals. Greenpeace, which has been assessing the area, warned of an \u201cecological disaster\u201d. Officials said tests showed above-permitted levels of phenol and petroleum products. Experts were investigating whether this was linked to spills of toxic substances, Solodov said. He added that divers had confirmed the deaths of sea creatures and pollution appeared to be spread over a wide area. Officials are scrambling to find the cause after President Vladimir Putin in June reacted angrily to the late reporting of an oil leak in Arctic Siberia that poured thousands of tons of diesel into land and waterways. The ecology minister, Dmitry Kobylkin, said in televised comments that Putin had ordered him to establish the cause of the situation. The Kamchatka governor, dressed in a \u201cI/We are the Pacific Ocean\u201d T-shirt, vowed on Instagram to lead a \u201ctransparent\u201d investigation and sack any official who covered up the scale of the pollution. He said there would be checks on Tuesday at two military testing sites, Radygino and Kozelsky, that could be responsible, citing a \u201cyellow film\u201d on a local river. \u201cEarly tomorrow morning there will be inspections of two key test sites that are raising everyone\u2019s concerns,\u201d he said. Some experts have suggested highly toxic rocket fuel could have leaked into the sea. The first test site, Radygino, is about six miles (10km) from the sea and was used for drills in August. Vladimir Burkanov, a biologist specialising in seals, in a comment published by the Novaya Gazeta opposition newspaper, suggested old stores of rocket fuel kept in Radygino could have rusted and the fuel leaked into streams. The other site, Kozelsky, has been used to bury toxic chemicals and pesticides, according to the governor\u2019s website. Greenpeace said its team had seen patches of yellowish foam and murky water in several locations, with some pollution drifting towards a Unesco-protected area of volcanoes. The group said it saw dead animals in one area. Kobylkin said in televised comments that so far tests had found only slightly raised levels of iron and phosphates and suggested the incident might not be manmade but caused by the stormy conditions and micro-organisms altering the oxygen levels. Environmental inspectors and experts from a fisheries and oceanography research centre were continuing tests. Greenpeace said it had contacted state ecological monitors, the armed forces and the prosecutor general\u2019s office urging an immediate investigation. Prosecutors and investigators announced they would carry out checks into whether a crime had been committed but have not released any findings. The emergencies ministry said it was using boats and drones to monitor the coastline but no pollution was visible. Solodov said it was a problem that the region had no unified system of environmental monitoring. The pristine peninsula is a popular destination for adventure tourism because of an abundance of wildlife and live volcanoes. The incident came as authorities urged tourists not to visit a live volcano on Kamchatka owing to fears of an imminent eruption. "},
{"text": "U.S. and Russian negotiators made progress Monday on a new framework accord that would freeze each side\u2019s nuclear arsenal and outline the parameters for a detailed treaty that would be negotiated next year, a senior Trump administration official said. The accord, if it comes together in the coming month, would give each side something it has sought. President Trump would have a demonstration that his diplomacy toward Moscow has borne fruit, arriving before the November election. Russia would get , which cuts long-range arms and is due to expire in early February. \u201cThis is the first time the U.S. has heard concrete proposals from the Russian Federation,\u201d said the administration official. \u201cWe have an agreement on the way forward in terms of form. Where we have a lot of work to do is in terms of substance.\u201d A week ago, the two sides said they were far apart on core issues in the negotiations and that the prospects for a framework accord this year appeared dim. But the developments described by the administration official on Monday suggested that the U.S. and Russia might be able to come to terms on some of the broad principles of a future treaty while deferring some thorny issues to future negotiations over the concrete provisions of that agreement. Monday\u2019s meeting, which was arranged in Helsinki on short notice, was conducted by Marshall Billingslea, the top U.S. negotiator, and Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. It built on a Friday meeting in Geneva between national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien and his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, and earlier discussions Mr. Trump had with Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. officials said. Russian officials haven't publicly discussed their proposals, and Mr. Ryabkov didn't respond to an emailed request for comment. Though neither side disclosed the details of the Monday discussion, the administration official said the framework accord under discussion would include a politically binding commitment to freeze the total number of nuclear warheads on each side. As described by the U.S., that freeze would cover warheads that are deployed on systems of all ranges as well as those that are in storage. It would be linked to the extension of the New START treaty for a year or longer, which would provide time for talks on the more far-reaching treaty. Diplomats said that each side had presented new ideas at the Monday meeting, which now need to be digested. Mr. Billingslea and Mr. Ryabkov plan to talk by phone next week to see if there is a basis for moving forward. Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists said that a freeze would leave each side with an ample arsenal of long-range and short-range systems. The U.S. has deployed 1,750 nuclear weapons on its long-range and shorter-range delivery systems, among the 3,800 nuclear warheads in its stockpile, according to Federation notes. Russia has 1,572 deployed warheads among the 4,310 in its stockpile, the FAS By extending New START, each side would be precluded from restructuring their arsenal to vastly increase the number of warheads carried by their long-range land-based ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles and bombers. That accord, which both sides have observed, sets a limit of 1,550 on the number of warheads that can be deployed on long-range systems. Mr. Billingslea and Mr. Ryabkov held two previous negotiating sessions in Vienna, where the two sides were far apart on the Trump administration\u2019s central demand that a future treaty limit all Russia, Chinese and U.S. warheads and include more intrusive verification. In an effort to step up the pressure on Moscow, Mr. Billingslea told the Russian newspaper Kommersant last month that the U.S. would move to expand its arsenal if the two sides remained stalemated and the New START treaty lapsed. Mr. Ryabkov countered in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week that Russia was prepared to respond to such steps and wasn\u2019t willing to secure the extension of New START \u201cat the price which the U.S. wants us to pay.\u201d But even as the negotiators outlined tough stances, interest in Washington and Moscow in further talks continued. After Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s Geneva session with his Russian counterpart, Mr.\u00a0Billingslea cut short a diplomatic swing through Asia and flew to Helsinki from Hanoi. One major sticking point has been Mr. Trump\u2019s longstanding demand that a future treaty limit \u2014a demand Beijing has long rebuffed. In August, however, the Trump administration shifted course and signaled that it was prepared to negotiate a separate framework accord with Moscow and attempt to bring China on board later once negotiations on a comprehensive treaty are under way. Russia has said that it is prepared to sign a treaty that covers the forces of several countries. But Moscow has said that it is up to China to decide if it wants to be included and that it is more important to include British and French nuclear forces. A possible diplomatic solution, former officials say, may be for a framework agreement that says that a future treaty should be multilateral without specifically mentioning China. The senior administration official summed up the meeting this way: \u201csubstantial progress but no breakthrough yet.\u201d Arms-control proponents say a framework accord would be valuable if it leads to the extension of New START, but they caution that the negotiation of a future treaty could prove difficult given how far apart the sides have been on what that agreement should cover. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, has said that he favors the extension of the New START treaty as a foundation for future arms-control arrangements. But he hasn\u2019t spelled out the details of what those arrangements should be. Copyright \u00a92020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The request to U.S. Strategic Command in Nebraska is part of a strategy to pressure Moscow into renegotiating the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty before the U.S. presidential election, the people said. In making the request, the Trump administration wants to underscore that it is serious about letting the treaty lapse if Russia fails to meet U.S. demands. The negotiating team is leery that Russia is dragging out the talks in the hope that Joe Biden \u2014 who has pledged to extend New START under what Moscow believes will be more favorable terms than what this White House is offering \u2014 wins the election. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear signal that the costs for not negotiating before the election are going to go up,\u201d said one of the people, who requested anonymity to relay sensitive discussions. The Trump administration is \u201ctrying to create an incentive, and it\u2019s a real incentive, for the Russians to sit down and actually negotiate.\u201d The request for the assessment came from a group of officials at the National Security Council and State, Defense and Energy departments that\u2019s supporting Ambassador Marshall Billingslea in negotiations with Moscow to try to replace New START before it runs out in February. how long it would take to load nuclear weapons now in reserve onto long-range bombers, ballistic missile submarines and land-based silos to beef up the U.S. nuclear force in the event Russia increases its arsenal. It comes as Billingslea has publicly raised the possibility of putting more weapons on bombers and submarines if New START lapses and has sharpened his rhetoric in recent days to try to secure more concessions from the Russians. \u201cIt would certainly be a question that you would want to ask STRATCOM,\u201d said retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Frank Klotz, who oversaw nuclear forces before serving as head of the DOE\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration. \u201cYou would want to fully understand all the possible implications of your negotiating approach, both if it should succeed or, alternatively, if it should fail.\" But former senior arms control and military officials also consider the move a risky gambit. It could send a message that the Trump administration, which has already pulled out of two other nuclear-related treaties with Russia, is no longer interested in any limits on the world\u2019s largest arsenals. And it could goad the Russians into taking similar steps. \u201cI call that megaphone diplomacy,\u201d said Rose Gottemoeller, who served as deputy secretary general of NATO until last year and negotiated New START when she was at the State Department. \u201cDo we want to end up in a less stable place? Because we would be nuclear arms racing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very stupid,\u201d added a former GOP arms control official who declined to be identified because he still advises the government. \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense to threaten to upload. It becomes a valid leveraging point only if the other side can\u2019t do it. The Russians can do it, too.\u201d \u201cBut more importantly,\u201d this person added, \u201cthe systems we have deployed today are the ones we believe are necessary to provide an adequate deterrent. There is no obvious reason and every reason not to in the absence of a change in the threat. It\u2019s not going to scare the Russians. The likelihood of success with the Russians is about nil.\" A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on Billingslea's behalf. Capt. Bill Clinton, a spokesperson for Strategic Command, declined to address the military\u2019s role in the deliberations. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about future operations, and really can\u2019t speculate on arms control talks (as that is not [our] responsibility),\u201d he wrote in an email. An NSC spokesperson declined to comment. New START, signed in 2010, mandated both sides draw down to and includes provisions to verify compliance, including reciprocal on-site inspections of nuclear bases. The pact is set to expire on Feb. 5 unless both sides agree to an extension for up to five years. The latest news in defense policy and politics.

The position of the Trump administration, which withdrew from both the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces and the Open Skies treaties, has been that New START is too narrow and a replacement is needed that covers more classes of weapons, such as \u201ctactical\u201d or battlefield nuclear weapons. At the outset of negotiations in June, the U.S. also insisted that China be party to any new agreement, but dropped that demand after Beijing balked. The U.S. negotiating team has insisted on a number of Russian concessions: a commitment to follow-on talks about a new arms deal that includes all U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons; a pledge to eventually bring in China, which is projected to double its relatively small nuclear arsenal in the next decade; and strong compliance measures. Billingslea\u2019s current public negotiating position is that the U.S. and Russia must agree on at least the outlines of a new framework that both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin can sign in order for Washington to consider extending New START. Asked in an interview published last week by a Russian newspaper if the Trump administration would scrap the treaty if the two sides can\u2019t agree on such a \u201cpresidential agreement,\u201d Billingslea responded, \u201cabsolutely.\u201d \u201cIn such a situation, we will not extend the treaty,\u201d he told Kommersant, according to an English translation of the interview. \u201cGiven all the deficiencies of New START, we consider it disadvantageous to the United States. It imposes constraints on the United States that it does not impose on Russia.\u201d In the same interview, Billingslea also indicated that the United States would take steps to increase the number of its deployed nuclear warheads if the pact is not extended. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, we will simply reconvert our weapons as soon as the treaty expires in February,\u201d he told the newspaper. Billingslea also said that the longer the Russians delay, the less attractive it would be for Moscow. \u201cI suspect that after President Trump wins reelection, if Russia has not taken up our offer, that the price of admission, as we would say in the U.S., goes up,\u201d he said. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands. | Chris McGrath/Getty Images that the U.S. could spend Russia, as well as China, \u201cinto oblivion\u201d in a Already, the U.S. and Russia have a much larger number of weapons in storage that could be placed on alert if they decided to take that course. , which tracks global inventories of atomic arms, the U.S. has 3,800 warheads stockpiled, while Russia has 4,310. Some in reserve could be made ready to deploy more quickly than others, according to , director of FAS\u2019 Nuclear Security Project. Of the three legs of the nuclear triad \u2014 bombers, submarines and missile silos \u2014 the quickest would be the bombers. \u201cThose weapons are just a few hundred yards from the aircraft,\u201d Kristensen said. \u201cThey could be loaded in days. Others would have to be transported to the bases. Maybe a week or so.\u201d Next would be the fleet of Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines, beginning with those already in port and the rest when they return from deployment. Finally, there are the intercontinental ballistic missiles deployed in underground silos at bases in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. \u201cThe slowest leg would be the ICBMs,\u201d Kristensen said. \u201cThey only have so much capacity to do that. That\u2019s a very slow process. That would take a long time for 400 silos. Many months.\u201d Both the ICBMs and the subs currently carry only one nuclear warhead on each missile, but they are designed to carry more. If the U.S. decides to upload all of its reserve force, \u201cit would more than double the deployed force,\u201d Kristensen added. \u201cThe question of course is why.\u201d To the Trump administration, the STRATCOM assessment is necessary to be prepared for the treaty to expire, but also to strengthen its hand with the Russians. \u201cI think there\u2019s an element of, \u2018the Russians might not make a deal, we need to be ready,\u2019\" said a former White House official who is one of the three people familiar with negotiations. \u201cThe administration is planning on what to do the day after. They want to be ready, but being ready doesn\u2019t actually mean that they will.\" \u201cWe don\u2019t just want to rubber stamp New START, so we need to start doing some prudent planning to see what other options there are,\u201d the first person familiar with the discussions added. \u201cThey\u2019re getting ready with options to raise the price.\u201d But at what cost, asked a number of veterans of nuclear negotiations who said they were alarmed at the administration\u2019s strategy. Rose Gottemoeller speaks at a conference on nuclear disarmament in 2017. | Alessandra Tarantino/AP Photo Gottemoeller, who is now a research fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, expressed concern the approach could merely increase the chances of a new arms race if New START expires. \u201cWe can upload,\u201d she said, referring to the U.S. reserve nuclear stockpile. \u201cBut the Russians can upload, too. I would argue they could get a jump on us.\u201d Klotz, who also served as defense attach\u00e9 in Moscow during previous arms control negotiations and at the government-funded Rand Corporation, agreed. \u201cIt's my personal view that the United States might initially be at a disadvantage,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russian nuclear modernization program is already well underway, while the U.S. program is still in its very early stages. Moreover, the systems the Russians have developed generally have the ability to carry more warheads than analogous U.S. systems.\u201d The Trump administration, he added, \u201crather glibly says, \u2018we'll spend you into oblivion\u2019 in any potential nuclear arms race. But wouldn\u2019t it be far better to avoid getting into that situation in the first place, especially when there are so many other capabilities our military needs?\u201d Kristensen, of the Federation of American Scientists, said the prospect of setting off a new competition to increase the two sides\u2019 arsenals \u201conly underscores the need to keep New START to keep those numbers in check.\u201d \u201cWithout it you don\u2019t really know where you are going.\u201d "},

Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has been placed on Russia\u2019s wanted list, the country\u2019s interior ministry has said. The 38-year-old, who took refuge in European Union member Lithuania following her claim to have beaten long-running leader Alexander Lukashenko in August elections, is \u201cwanted on a criminal charge,\u201d the Russian interior ministry told AFP on Wednesday. The Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that Tikhanovskaya faces a charge in Belarus of making public calls to harm the country\u2019s security, including calls to seize power. Russian news agencies cited law enforcement sources as saying that her listing appeared automatically due to Moscow\u2019s commitments as part of a \u201cunion state\u201d with neighbouring Belarus. Belarus has not announced Tikhanovskaya as wanted, however. Belarusian interior ministry spokeswoman Olga Chemodanova told the country\u2019s Tut.by independent news site, \u201cSo far, I don\u2019t have information that I could tell you.\u201d Tikhanovskaya\u2019s campaign office told the Russian Interfax news agency: \u201cWe don\u2019t know about this. Svetlana did not receive any messages. But this is actually of little interest [to us].\u201d Numerous key allies of Tikhanovskaya have been detained on the charge of making public calls to harm the country\u2019s security or driven out of the country by threats from the authorities. Huge crowds have gathered for protests every weekend in Belarus since the elections, despite harsh police tactics including the use of tear gas and water cannon, supporting Tikhanovskaya\u2019s call for new elections to be held according to international standards. A political novice until her campaign to end Lukashenko\u2019s 26-year rule brought thousands out onto the streets of Belarus, Tikhanovskaya has recently met European leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, she said it was not up to Putin to decide the fate of her country but added that she would welcome his involvement in mediating the political crisis. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to say that Putin has to decide how to solve our problems. This is our internal problem,\u201d she told reporters in the German parliament\u2019s lower house, the Bundestag. \u201cWe want to invite him to be a mediator,\u201d she said in English. Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday the Russian leader, who has strongly backed Lukashenko, had no plans to meet her. \u201cNo contacts are being planned,\u201d Peskov told reporters. \u201cTikhanovskaya is not in Belarus. One can hardly say that she is somehow involved in Belarus\u2019s life. \u201cShe is meeting with various heads of state and government who consider Belarus\u2019s sitting president illegitimate.\u201d The EU and the United States have refused to recognise Lukashenko\u2019s inauguration as president last month, citing rigged polls. EU leaders have approved sanctions against Belarus officials but not against Lukashenko himself, prompting Belarus to announce counter-sanctions against unnamed officials. Tikhanovskaya, an English teacher by training, is campaigning against Lukashenko despite the Belarusian authorities holding her husband Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular opposition blogger, in prison in pre-trial detention. She sent the couple\u2019s two young children abroad before her own departure. "},

Academics from the University of Oxford interviewed almost two dozen current and former RT journalists about their time at the Kremlin-backed media outlet. Russia's state media actively promoted Brexit supporters and undermined Hillary Clinton's 2016 U.S. presidential bid as part of a yearslong campaign to sow doubt among Western democracies, according to almost two dozen current and former journalists for RT, the Kremlin-backed outlet. from the Oxford Internet Institute published Monday, involved Moscow using RT's global network of news sites in more than 30 languages to push anti-West narratives, sow conspiracy theories to cast doubt on traditional media outlets and foment controversy to boost Russia's presence on the global stage, based on anonymous interviews with the RT journalists. They spoke to the academics on the condition of anonymity in part because many had signed nondisclosure agreements that included hefty financial penalties for speaking publicly. \"Creating controversy for RT was the whole point,\" said , who co-authored the study and is a Ph.D. student at the Oxford Internet Institute. \"Bad publicity is good publicity for them.\" The inside look at RT's activities comes as national security agencies and disinformation experts remain concerned about Russian efforts to interfere in Western elections. With just over a month to go before the U.S. presidential vote, the Kremlin to sow division among an already-polarized electorate, while in Europe, local officials of trying to interfere in last year's European Parliament election. The United Kingdom's Brexit referendum and the 2016 U.S. presidential election were key moments in RT's strategy. Many of these activities have been covert, including using sophisticated campaigns on social media networks that often portrayed Russian operatives as local voters. But RT \u2014 which has tens of millions of followers across social media \u2014 is a vocal part of the country's propaganda operation, according to the 23 journalists who spoke to the University of Oxford academics. Their efforts included skewing news output to promote narratives that showed the West as corrupt, divided and out of touch. During the recent unrest and violence amid protests against racism in the United States, for instance, RT to its millions of online followers, according to an analysis of recent Twitter posts by POLITICO. \"Would they twist stories, or make facts, or reshape things, or twist a narrative? Absolutely,\" one of the reporters told the researchers. \"It\u2019s less than about changing the story, just omitting facts.\" The United Kingdom's Brexit referendum and the 2016 U.S. presidential election were key moments in RT's strategy \u2014 tactics that have grown more sophisticated over the last four years, according to the interviews that took place between January 2018 and March 2019. Ahead of the 2016 U.K. vote, RT journalists were urged to give more airtime to Brexit supporters, including Nigel Farage. When one reporter asked his editor what was the Kremlin-backed outlet's goal during the referendum, the response was: \"Anything that causes chaos is RT's line,\" based on one of the anonymous interviews. While U.S. national intelligence agencies have alleged the Kremlin actively sought to undermine the 2016 U.S. presidential election, RT journalists said they were never told to promote Donald Trump. Instead, the goal was to run stories attacking Clinton, his Democratic opponent. \"During the run-up to the election, I remember bashing Clinton, criticizing Clinton all the time because RT themselves did not believe that Trump would win,\" said one of the reporters. When Elswah, the Oxford researcher, asked the journalists if they felt guilty for their role in Russia's propaganda machine, many \u2014 but not all \u2014 admitted that they were ashamed for how they had portrayed global events on behalf of RT. \"They definitely felt guilty,\" she said. \"The most common feeling was guilt.\" In-depth reporting, data and actionable intelligence for policy professionals \u2013 all in one place.

{"text": "Head of armed forces says both China and Russia trying to undermine cohesion in west is seeking to destabilise countries around the world by sowing disinformation about coronavirus vaccines that is shared rapidly across social media, the head of the armed forces has warned. Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of defence staff, said the propaganda tactic reflected a strategy of \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d aggressively undertaken by Beijing as well as Moscow \u201cdesigned to undermine cohesion\u201d across the west. The senior general accused \u201cautocratic rivals\u201d of \u201cmanipulating the information environment\u201d to exploit the Covid-19 crisis for strategic gain \u2013 including \u201cpro-Russian vaccine politics\u201d \u2013 in a speech Their \u201cdisinformation narratives\u201d were designed to permeate anti-vaccination social media groups, Carter added, In July, a fake press release was posted to websites of the pro-Russian self-declared state in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine. It falsely claimed that the US had conducted vaccine trials on Ukrainian volunteers, some of whom had died. The trials never happened but the misleading narrative spread in several languages, including on , despite multiple attempts to fact-check and Carter said it was an example of \u201cdigital authoritarianism\u201d alongside well-known Kremlin cyber and hacking attacks, in a rare policy speech delivered with the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, sitting alongside him. A similar approach was adopted by China, he added, where \u201cthe Chinese Communist party is forging a future of mass surveillance\u201d and ranking and monitoring of individuals based on how they behave online. The speech comes in the run-up to a five-year integrated review of defence and foreign policy that is expected to see the UK seek to invest more heavily in cyber and covert capabilities, reflecting a belief that Britain is already engaged in a persistent low-level conflict with authoritarian rivals. The British army already operates a propaganda and disinformation suppression unit, 77 Brigade. But the military is traditionally tight-lipped about the scope and scale of its activities and Carter\u2019s speech offered few precise clues as to how the UK will respond. Senior defence sources said scaling up Britain\u2019s information warfare capability was \u201cnot going to be a massive increase of expense\u201d and that it would involve, in part, closer intelligence and information sharing with a range of allies. \u201cThe bill that\u2019s attached is not significant,\u201d they said. Countries such as Russia and China, Carter argued, \u201csee the strategic context as a continuous struggle in which non-military and military instruments are used unconstrained by any distinction between peace and war\u201d. The general added: \u201cTheir goal is to win without going to war: to achieve their objectives by breaking our willpower, using attacks below the threshold that would prompt a war-fighting response.\u201d In the summer, Britain accused Russian state-sponsored hackers of in the UK, US and Canada involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine, with the apparent intention of stealing the research. Intelligence officials said the cyber-attackers were from a group called APT29, linked variously to the country\u2019s FSB or SVR intelligence agencies, in attacks that were described by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. As part of the military\u2019s response, Carter unveiled . It recognised the need \u201cto compete below the threshold of war in order to deter war\u201d to prevent \u201cone\u2019s adversaries from achieving their objectives in fait accompli strategies\u201d.

{"text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Plans for Russia\u2019s biggest corporate deal of 2020 collapsed on Friday after talks over a $5.48 billion cash-and-share sale of online bank Tinkoff to internet giant Yandex ended. Discussions over the potential tie-up, which would have increased competition for Russia\u2019s largest lender Sberbank and smaller rivals in technology and banking, stalled less than four weeks after they were announced by Tinkoff parent TCS Group Holding. TCS said in a statement it had agreed with Yandex not to proceed with the transaction, but Tinkoff would continue to partner with it on existing and future projects. \u201cToday I decided to break the possible deal with Yandex,\u201d TCS founder Oleg Tinkov said in an internal email which was seen by Reuters on Friday. Tinkov, a major TCS shareholder, could not be reached for comment and the online bank\u2019s press office declined to comment. Yandex shares fell 2.2% in Moscow to 4,652.0 roubles ($59.64) at 1451 GMT, while TCS Group\u2019s London-listed shares were 1.3% lower, after earlier hitting a three-month low. TCS and Yandex announced they were in talks on Sept. 22, a few months after Yandex said it was ending its partnership with Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest lender. Tinkov said in his email that Yandex was interested only in a takeover of Tinkoff, the world\u2019s largest fully online bank with more than 10 million customers across Russia, whereas Tinkov viewed the deal as a merger. Yandex had agreed that Tinkov would be involved in managing the bank and help Yandex in general after the deal, Tigran Khudaverdyan, Yandex\u2019s deputy CEO, said in a post on his corporate blog, confirmed as genuine by its press department. Khudaverdyan said Tinkov had made more demands after each stage of talks and his decision did not come as a surprise. Tinkov had previously played down talk of an acquisition, insisting the deal being discussed with Yandex was not a sale but a merger. \u201cTinkoff is not for sale, neither to Yandex, nor MTS,\u201d Tinkov said, referring to reports that TCS was in discussions to sell the bank to Russia\u2019s top mobile operator MTS. And Vladimir Yevtushenkov, head of Sistema, MTS\u2019 major shareholder, told Reuters he not been approached by Tinkov.

{"text": "The giant hogweed isn\u2019t just an invasive plant. It\u2019s a metaphor for what is happening to much of this country. Ms. Antonova is a journalist and science writer. BALASHIKHA, Russia \u2014 Take any of the many highways out of the Russian capital and you can dissect the country\u2019s strata like rings on a tree. Sentinel apartment towers replace the bustling illuminated center, then the belt of auto dealerships and box stores drifts by. Gradually, the landscape becomes sparse, with villages and towns sporadically punctuating the stretch of meadows and forests for thousands of miles in every direction. Russia is the biggest country on Earth and both the state and the people take pride in the size of its territory \u2014 \u201cfrom the southern seas to the polar fringes,\u201d as the current national anthem goes. That quiet emptiness, the enormousness of Russia, has been infiltrated in recent decades by an alien force: the giant hogweed. This invader, an exceptionally tall plant with a toxic sap that can cause third-degree burns and blindness, has come to symbolize the fate of rural Russia: malign neglect by the government. While Russia may be vast, most economic activity \u2014 and much of life in general \u2014 is concentrated in a handful of cities. And after various Soviet-era attempts to develop land through centralized planning, there is evidence that the current government is doing the exact opposite. Enter the hogweed. In the summer, the giant hogweed assumes the look of dill on steroids; its coffee-table sized leaves create thickets impossible to pass without a hazmat suit. In the winter, it desiccates into a brown skeleton. Outside Moscow, the hogweeds are often the only visible landmarks over white fields, ominous umbrellas standing in the snow like War of the Worlds troops poised to march. Officials have begun to refer to overgrown areas as \u201ccontaminated.\u201d Giant hogweeds grow naturally in the Caucasus Mountains. Evolving to thrive on shifting soils, they compete with other high-altitude herbage by yielding extraordinary seed counts \u2014 up to 100,000 per plant. The plant\u2019s Latin name, Heracleum, hints at its extraordinary strength. In Central Russia, where typical meadow grasses are much shorter, it quickly overpowers all local species. \u201cOur plants cannot compete with it,\u201d Dmitry Geltman, the director of the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told me. \u201cIt takes over deserted fields because it likes unstable soil. For any alien species, it is easier to infiltrate a fluctuating community.\u201d Mr. Geltman speaks in botanical terms, but he could be talking about life in rural Russia, which has experienced a relentless population exodus since the 1990s. Russia has some 222 million hectares of agricultural land, nearly 100 million of which are unused, according to a 2016 census. Much of this vast territory \u2014 386,000 square miles, about twice the size of Spain \u2014 was abandoned after the breakup of the Soviet Union because it was unprofitable to farm. As humans left, the hogweed advanced. It seems the government doesn\u2019t know what to do with the land, or the people on it: Rural Russians are twice as poor and jobless as those living in urban areas. Research has shown that the number of farms in the country halved between 2006 and 2016. The top 1 percent of all agricultural companies receive two-thirds of all investment \u2014 just 61 companies collectively own over 14 million hectares of farmland and prefer to use seasonal migrant labor. Rural Russians are shut out of economic opportunity. Vasily Melnichenko, a straight-talking farmer from the Ural Mountains who heads a movement for rural development, says President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government\u2019s policy toward rural Russia has been awful. Rural people are seen as a \u201cburden,\u201d he said, sapping budget funding for roads, electricity and health care. \u201cIt has gone on too long to be a mistake, but if it\u2019s done on purpose, then that would mean we\u2019re governed by enemies,\u201d Mr. Melnichenko told me. \u201cThere have been dozens of road maps and national projects, but nobody can carry them out. There is a complete inability to understand the territory.\u201d Another 20 years of the same, he said, and all the remaining residents will die out, ending the Russian village as a form of life. The giant hogweed is what happens when a land loses its stewards. The weed is expanding its coverage by about 10 percent every year. It now creeps to the margins of forests and rivers, even near urban areas. Even the heavily built-up Moscow region had almost 270 square miles contaminated with giant hogweed this summer, according to the regional government. In the Tver region, which lies between Moscow and St. Petersburg and is the size of Austria, the hogweed has permeated a third of towns and villages. The invasion is one of the many environmental disasters brought on by Soviet centralized planning. After World War II, Soviet agronomists, keen to quickly rebuild the country\u2019s agriculture industry, thought that the plant\u2019s impressive biomass could make it a good crop to feed livestock. Seeds were distributed throughout the country. Hogweed contains a high concentration of furanocoumarins, substances that cause severe burns and blisters when affected areas of skin are exposed to sunlight. Even so, the plant was grown nationwide. By the 1980s, when the plant began infiltrating central Russia\u2019s wilderness, tests showed that cows fed on hogweed produced poor-tasting milk. Efforts to make the plant less toxic failed. The plague could not be contained. While some regional governments now try to spray problem zones with pesticides, Moscow hasn\u2019t paid the problem any attention or sought to understand its scope. Tatarstan, the only region to monitor its spread, has pleaded for federal help, saying that the area overtaken by the hogweed grew tenfold in the past eight years, with thousands of burn victims and even fatalities. Some activists and scientists are experimenting with solutions, ranging from hogweed-eating snails to moonshine production. One evening I joined an activist, Maria Popova, on a hogweed raid outside the Russian capital. We equipped ourselves with gloves, goggles and large kitchen knives on the edge of a field that is part of the popular Losiny Ostrov National Park \u2014 a large nature area close to Moscow. \u201cIf you don\u2019t interfere, the hogweeds multiply at a crazy rate and soon there is nothing but them,\u201d she said as we hiked through the tall grass. Ms. Popova started patrolling the nearby fields when she came across \u201cplantations\u201d of hogweed on one of her walks.

{"text": "MOSCOW\u2014Armenia and Azerbaijan announced a cease-fire after nearly two weeks of intense fighting that has claimed hundreds of lives following Russia-brokered talks over the The foreign ministers of the two warring countries said in a statement early Saturday that the truce, which began at noon local time, is intended to provide space to exchange prisoners and recover the dead. The announcement followed more than 10 hours of negotiations in Moscow mediated by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who said that specific details will be agreed on later as talks continue. Azerbaijan and Armenia \u201care starting substantive negotiations with the aim of achieving a peaceful settlement as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said, adding that the talks would be mediated by Russia, the U.S. and France. Underscoring the precariousness of any truce in the volatile region, both sides accused each other of violating the cease-fire shortly after it took effect. Armenia said Azeri units launched an assault five minutes after 12 p.m. Azerbaijan, meanwhile, said that Armenian armed forces were firing on Azeri regions. Roughly the size of Delaware, the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh\u2014a disputed enclave controlled by ethnic Armenians but internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan\u2014has been a flashpoint between the two countries since the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The fighting flared up last month after nearly three decades of on-again, off-again skirmishes. A six-year war that ended in a 1994 cease-fire claimed some 30,000 lives. Both sides have blamed each other for triggering the current outbreak of hostilities on Sept. 27. Armenia said Friday that 376 of its soldiers had been killed in the fighting so far, while Azerbaijan hasn\u2019t disclosed how many of its troops have been killed. Authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said the conflict so far has cost at least 22 lives and injured more than 80 people. Azerbaijan said 31 Azeri On Saturday, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev said that the military part of the conflict has ended. But in a sign that the peace negotiations will be challenging, he said that Armenia must agree that the territory belongs to Azerbaijan. \u201cNow we have reached a political settlement that will ensure that we reach the end and get what rightfully belongs to us,\u201d he told Russian media outlet RBC. For Russia, which has close ties with both Armenia and Azerbaijan and regards the former Soviet republics as part of its sphere of influence, a successful cease-fire would amount to a diplomatic feat and help solidify its role as a mediator in the region. It comes as , from Belarus in the west to Kyrgyzstan in the east, are upending the Kremlin\u2019s plans for deeper economic and defense ties with the former Soviet republics. The Kremlin has long worked to keep Armenia and Azerbaijan bound tightly to Moscow due to their strategic location along an important energy corridor coveted by the West. The truce announced Saturday follows phone calls this week between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Armenian and Azeri leaders, after which the Kremlin leader called for halting the hostilities on humanitarian grounds. Underscoring Moscow\u2019s desire to take the leading role in mediating the conflict, Mr. Putin on Saturday discussed the cease-fire with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, another regional power, which has relations with both Yerevan and Baku. The truce also comes after officials from the U.S., France and Russia, which have led mediation for almost three decades as co-chairs of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u2019s Minsk Group, have begun a concerted effort to reach a solution. A personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal. France on Saturday welcomed the cease-fire, but said it now had to be fully implemented. \u201cIt must now be implemented and strictly observed in order to create the conditions for a permanent cessation of hostilities between the two countries,\u201d the French foreign ministry said in a statement. During the current flare-up in fighting, , throwing its support behind Azerbaijan, with which it shares ethnic and cultural ties. Turkey is already involved in two proxy conflicts with Russia\u2014in Libya, where it is supporting the internationally recognized government against rebels backed by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and in Syria, where Moscow is a staunch ally of President Bashar al-Assad. The Turkish government didn\u2019t immediately comment on the cease-fire announcement. Earlier this week, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said a truce wouldn\u2019t be enough to resolve the conflict because it would leave Armenia in control of parts of Azerbaijan\u2019s territory. \u201cA cease-fire can take place, but what will be the result?\u201d Mr. Cavusoglu said during a visit to Azerbaijan on Tuesday. \u201cCan you tell Armenia to immediately withdraw from Azeri land?\u201d Since the conflict restarted, each side has accused the other of indiscriminate shelling of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, on both sides of the contact line that separates Armenian and Azeri forces. Roads, electricity and gas and communication networks have also been damaged across the region, officials from both countries say, though each denies targeting civilians.

{"text": "In-depth reporting, data and actionable intelligence for policy professionals \u2013 all in one place. Ahead of visit to meet EU leaders in Brussels, Ukraine\u2019s comedian-turned-president reiterates commitment to peace process. Press play to listen to this article Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the former comedian whose party is called \u201cServant of the People\u201d after the TV show he once starred in, has some advice for his strongman neighbors, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko: Listen to the people. In an interview with POLITICO ahead of a visit to Brussels on Tuesday, Zelenskiy said he gets an eerily familiar feeling watching the protests in Belarus, and also in Khabarovsk in Russia\u2019s far east \u2014 given that Ukraine has had not one but two street revolutions already this century. \u201cWhat is happening today in Khabarovsk is, I think, the very clear position of people who come out [on to the streets] \u2014 that they have an opinion,\u201d Zelenskiy said in the interview. \u201cAnd this is the most important thing \u2014 that they cannot be influenced by only the information policy of the Russian Federation. You can\u2019t brainwash them. It is clear that at any moment there will be a social explosion. We see the same thing in Belarus today. People are tired of these politics.\u201d playing a fictional president on the satirical \u201cServant of the People\u201d sitcom last year, said that those in power must listen to those they serve, or face revolt. \u201cCan what is happening now in Belarus be the same in Russia? I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cBut what I see is that the people of Belarus [where protests have multiplied following the disputed reelection of President Lukashenko in August] will no longer stand for the policies that were before. Authorities need to listen to the people. And, most importantly, throwing people in police wagons for having a different opinion; or using batons; or certain means against people; you can\u2019t build a dialogue. People need to be heard. If people want change, then it\u2019s time for that change.\u201d Zelenskiy leads a country at war, and in the interview he said he will arrive to meet with EU leaders on Tuesday, bearing a request and an offer. Zelenskiy noted that Ukraine has had two recent revolutions \u2014 the Orange Revolution of 2004-05, and its Revolution of Dignity a decade later. \u201cI see there, approximately the same situation,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople do not want to live as before \u2026 If there is no dialogue, if the authorities do not talk about it with the people, and pretend that it is happening \u2018somewhere, in one area or another, this is not the whole country,\u2019 then there will be a wave. You know what the sea is \u2014 and a wave always washes away all the past.\u201d Zelenskiy leads a country at war, and in the interview he said he will arrive to meet with EU leaders on Tuesday, bearing a request and an offer. The request is that the EU continue, or even step up, its support for Ukraine in the ongoing conflict with Russia \u2014 by maintaining tough sanctions against Moscow, and further developing economic and political ties with Kyiv. The offer is to help manufacture a coronavirus vaccine once effective immunization is ready for mass production. In the interview, Zelenskiy reiterated his commitment to the Minsk II peace process, but also his firm view that local elections cannot be held in the embattled areas of eastern Ukraine \u2014 as demanded by Russian President Putin \u2014 until Ukraine regains full control of its external borders. Without control of the border, he said it would be impossible to hold a free and fair election and for international election observers to verify the process. \u201cThe Ukrainian border should be controlled by the Ukrainian authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cI say this openly and I believe that it cannot be otherwise \u2026 it\u2019s just physically impossible.\u201d Zelenskiy also said that Ukraine\u2019s destiny is now clearly in the West. \u201cUkrainians ,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand that this is the way to be a member of the EU. I believe that we are mentally more European than, sorry, some EU countries.\u201d In briefings on Monday, senior EU officials said they would use the meeting with Zelenskiy and European Council President Charles Michel to emphasize the bloc\u2019s political and economic support for Kyiv. They will encourage Zelenskiy to continue pushing efforts to reduce corruption and carry out an array of judicial and economic reforms. EU officials said they would also reiterate their support for maintaining sanctions against Russia, which Zelenskiy in the interview said is his top priority request. \u201cThe EU will continue to show our support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d a senior EU official said. Despite that support, the Minsk II peace agreement, brokered and guaranteed by France and Germany, has barely inched forward since with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 largely because of the standoff over holding local elections and changes to the Ukrainian constitution that would grant \u201cspecial status\u201d to the embattled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 both currently controlled by pro-Russian separatist administrations. Zelenskiy readily conceded that he did not agree with some provisions of the Minsk II accord | Sergey Dolzhenko/AFP via Getty Images After the December meeting, Zelenskiy worked with the Russians to negotiate an exchange of prisoners, bringing home some 140 captive Ukrainians, and a has led to a sharp reduction in hostilities. But his failure to end the war as promised during his election campaign has led to a sharp decline in support to roughly half of the 73 percent who voted for him, according to recent polls. In the interview, Zelenskiy readily conceded that he did not agree with some provisions of the Minsk II accord, negotiated by his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, such as those that required Ukraine to make constitutional changes, but that it was the only path to a settlement. \u201cMinsk was signed,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cAm I personally satisfied with the format of Minsk, the sequence of points in Minsk and the wording of some points that have been signed? Personally, I am not completely.\u201d But he added, \u201cThat this is the only format in which we work today is true.\u201d As for further constitutional changes demanded by Putin, he said: \u201cNo one can effect a change to the constitution of Ukraine except the people of Ukraine.\u201d \u201cIt is very important for us that Ukraine does not interfere in the elections of any country\u201d \u2014 Zelenskiy insisted that he had no choice but to engage with Putin, and in a sign of the , he mostly sidestepped a question about the Russian leader\u2019s role in the poisoning of the opposition figure Alexei Navalny. \u201cThe whole world is closely following the details and results of the investigation into the tragedy with Mr. Navalny, which are to be published by the German side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all want to see it.\u201d Zelenskiy similarly engaged in well-practiced evasive tactics when asked about the U.S. presidential election. Zelenskiy of President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment scandal, after the American leader withheld military aid to Ukraine in an effort to pressure Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. \u201cIt is very important for us that Ukraine does not interfere in the elections of any country,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all due respect to the United States \u2014 with all due respect to their main political decision, the presidential election \u2014 for me personally, it is more important to resolve the issue of war than elections in another country.\u201d Nor would he comment on any ongoing investigations. \u201cAs for criminal cases, our law enforcement officers deal with it,\u201d he said.\u201dI don\u2019t even want to have all the information.

This is the first time that China has been mentioned in the annual Central Bank report as a major foreign investor. In 2018 and 2019, it was not mentioned among the top 50 countries putting money into the country. The Chinese investments are classified as confidential in the report. However it is known that the China Road and Bridge Corporation, CRBC, is building the first section of the Montenegrin leg of the Bar-Boljare highway, covered by a $944 million loan from China\u2019s Exim Bank. On June 2020, Montenegro also signed a 54-million-euro contract with Chinese-Montenegrin consortium DEC International-Bemax-BB Solar-Permonte for the reconstruction of the Plevlja thermal power plant. According to the Central Bank report, from January to August, the total foreign investment amounted to 468 million euros, while in the same period last year it was 515 million euros. With 43.3 million euros invested, Italy was the second most important in terms of foreign direct investment. According to the Central Bank report, 7.9 million euros were invested through loans from Italian companies, while the remaining 35.4 million euros represented investments in Montenegrin companies and banks as well as the purchase of real estate. Russia was the largest investor in Montenegro last year, but is now in third place with 42.5 million euros invested. The Central Bank said that 15 million euros of this represented loans from Russian companies, while 14.4 million was invested in real estate. The remaining 13 million euros from Russia represents investments in Montenegrin companies and banks and the return of capital, but details of these items have been declared confidential.

Have you even been out on to the street?,\u201d he snapped, according to three accounts from the meeting. \u201cWe have spent Rbs4tn roubles\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009borrowed it on the market with interest. Why are you whining? We have cut budget spending by 10 per cent\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009what justice are you on about?\u201d The virtual meeting fell silent. The billionaires got the point. The tax raid may well be a harbinger of future measures forcing the natural resources industry to provide more financial support for the Kremlin. The pandemic appears to be heading for another wave of infections and economically damaging lockdowns this winter and into next year. planned before the pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis has left the country\u2019s finance ministry with a $50bn deficit this year, equivalent to around 4 per cent of gross domestic product. Hence the meeting with the industry bosses, who included steel tycoons Alexei Mordashov, owner of Severstal and worth $20bn and NLMK\u2019s Vladimir Lisin, worth $23bn. Many were outraged that the new tax had been sprung on them so suddenly. Few had expected such a sharp response. \u201c[Belousov] was rude, but he said that stuff in a way that it was obvious this had already been decided by the President,\u201d said one person involved in the discussion. \u201cHe had the meeting as a formality.\u201d The change that was presented \u2014 and passed by Russia\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament on Wednesday \u2014 was an increase in the mineral extraction tax on companies that mine metals, ores and rock used to make fertilisers by 3.5 times from next year. Moscow says this will raise Rbs56bn ($700m) and affect domestic production only, with no impact on export prices or global commodity markets.

The economic crisis caused by the pandemic, which has seen billions of roubles in state aid doled out to companies and households, has given it the perfect excuse to dust off the plan and redeploy it in a revised guise. In Russia\u2019s system of government, where powerful oligarchs and state companies often use their considerable influence to direct policy, many believe there may also have been heartfelt encouragement for the tax rise from other industries. Indeed, as Moscow pushed through the new charge and ended tax breaks for a number of oilfields in order to raise more cash, Kremlin-controlled oil producer Rosneft was simultaneously granted tax breaks for two of its developments. Rosneft\u2019s chief executive Igor Sechin, a close and old friend of President Vladimir Putin, has long argued that the tax treatment of mining and metals is far friendlier than that applied to the oil industry. The mining CEOs argue the tax rise will cut investment, hitting future output, job creation and economic growth. \u201cIt is ridiculous. But they understood what they could take from us, and they did,\u201d according to another person who was at the meeting. \u201cThe way in which it was done, the mechanism they used is wrong\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009And they will probably do it again.\u201d \u201cIs it a one-off? Is it for three years? Or is it forever?\u201d the first person asked. \u201cAnd the biggest worry is that they will keep coming back for more. Sure, Rbs56bn is OK but Rbs560bn is not,\u201d No company likes to pay more tax, even those that are reaping higher profits thanks to a weaker rouble that has lowered domestic costs and boosted export earnings. And oligarchs with fortunes larger than some small countries are no different. But Russia\u2019s metals and mining tycoons might be better off adopting Mr Belousov\u2019s tactic of accepting a rebuke, licking their wounds and saving their powder for future fights.

{"text": "A new book by one of the special counsel\u2019s top deputies, Andrew Weissmann, is the first inside account of the investigation. WASHINGTON \u2014 The team led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, failed to do everything it could to determine what happened in the 2016 election, shying away from steps like subpoenaing President Trump and scrutinizing his finances out of fear he would fire them, one of Mr. Mueller\u2019s top lieutenants argued in the first insider account of the inquiry. \u201cHad we used all available tools to uncover the truth, undeterred by the onslaught of the president\u2019s unique powers to undermine our efforts?\u201d wrote the former prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, in a new book, adding, \u201cI know the hard answer to that simple question: We could have done more.\u201d The team took elaborate steps to protect its files of evidence from the risk that the Justice Department might destroy them if Mr. Trump fired them and worked to keep reporters and the public from learning what they were up to, Mr. Weissmann wrote in \u201cWhere Law Ends: Inside the Mueller Investigation,\u201d which Random House will publish next week. While he speaks reverently of Mr. Mueller, he also says his boss\u2019s diffidence made him ill-suited for aspects of shepherding the politically charged investigation. He saw Mr. Mueller and his deputy, Aaron M. Zebley, as overly cautious. Mr. Weissmann also defended against accusations by the president and his allies that he and other investigators were politically biased \u201cangry Democrats\u201d; Mr. Weissmann said his personal views had no bearing on the crimes that Russian operatives and Trump aides committed. And he elevates particular details \u2014 for example, emphasizing that the that sent hush payments to an adult film star who alleged an extramarital affair with Mr. Trump had also received \u201cpayments linked to a Russian oligarch.\u201d The president has denied the affair; his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen controlled the account. Mr. Mueller transferred the Cohen matter to prosecutors in New York. Previously a mafia and Enron prosecutor and then a lawyer at the F.B.I. for Mr. Mueller, who was the bureau\u2019s director for 12 years, Mr. Weissmann ran one of three major units for the special counsel\u2019s office. His \u201cTeam M\u201d prosecuted Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort for numerous financial crimes. The goal was to flip him and learn whatever he knew about any Trump campaign links to Russia. Mr. Manafort had worked for pro-Russian interests in Ukraine, and the investigation uncovered ties by his business partner, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, to Russian intelligence. The book builds toward investigators\u2019 discovery that Mr. Manafort had shared internal campaign polling data with Mr. Kilimnik, who flew to the United States to meet with Mr. Manafort during the campaign, asking whether Mr. Trump would permit a peace plan for Russia to essentially take over all of eastern Ukraine. But while admitting this much, Mr. Manafort \u2014 seeing the dangle of a potential pardon from Mr. Trump \u2014 refused to cooperate further. Investigators did not obtain any final puzzle pieces and lacked the evidence to charge anyone in the campaign with a criminal conspiracy involving Russia\u2019s covert electoral assistance. \u201cIt would seem to require significant audacity \u2014 or else, leverage \u2014 for another nation to even put such a request before a presidential candidate,\u201d Mr. Weissmann wrote of Mr. Kilimnik\u2019s request. \u201cThis made what we didn\u2019t know, and still don\u2019t know to this day, monumentally disconcerting: Namely, why would Trump ever agree to this? Why would Trump ever agree to this Russian proposal if the candidate were not getting something from Russia in return?\u201d Mr. Weissmann explained the significance of Mr. Manafort\u2019s interactions with Mr. Kilimnik \u2014 also a major focus of , which explicitly labeled Mr. Kilimnik a Russian intelligence agent \u2014 more clearly than the Mueller report did. Mr. Mueller had strictly forbidden leaks, and the special counsel team took extraordinary care to protect the high-profile, high-stakes investigation, Mr. Weissmann wrote. They kept window blind slats tilted at an angle to keep out prying eyes, shutting out natural light. They concocted an \u201calmost comically elaborate and surreal\u201d plan to sneak in \u201cthrough the many hidden arteries of the courthouse\u201d to obtain a grand jury indictment without tipping off reporters. And worried about the possibility that Mr. Trump would fire them and the Justice Department would then seal off or destroy their evidence, the Mueller team members packed their numerous applications to judges for search warrants with extensive, up-to-date details about their investigation \u2014 ensuring they backed up their work beyond the reach of the executive branch. Ty Cobb, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, also privately promised to be a \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d and provide a heads up if Mr. Trump was going to fire the special counsel team, according to Mr. Weissmann. In an email, Mr. Cobb wrote that he \u201cnever made the commitment\u201d described by Mr. Weissmann. The investigation played out against the backdrop of regular vilification of the Mueller team by Mr. Trump and his allies like Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity \u2014 who turned out to be in regular contact with Mr. Manafort cooking up a \u201csmear campaign\u201d over text messages. Mr. Weissmann, a major target, wrote that such \u201cad hominem\u201d insinuations of bias appealed to emotion rather than reason. \u201cI am a registered Democrat,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDoes this make Paul Manafort or any of the other 32 people our office charged any less guilty? Did Russia not attack our democracy and disrupt our election with its self-described online information warfare operation? Which facts that we alleged in our various indictments \u2014 and to which many of those we indicted, including Manafort, would plead guilty \u2014 did our attackers believe were invented as a result of our alleged bias as \u2018angry Democrats?\u2019\u201d to documents showing that cellphones issued to Mr. Mueller\u2019s team were erased during the investigation; Mr. Weissmann twice entered an incorrect passcode too often, triggering a security measure that erased his phone. In an interview, he portrayed the concerns as a \u201ctempest in a teapot\u201d and said his understanding was that all emails and other such data from phones were backed up. He called on the Justice Department to release information about the special counsel\u2019s data backup system. Mr. Weissmann also wrote that he is not \u201canti-Trump\u201d but rather \u201cpro the rule of law.\u201d Still, the distinction is less than clear in a book that also portrays Mr. Trump as a liar and a dangerous demagogue trying \u201cto peel the world around him away from the rule of law \u2014 away from reason itself \u2014 and mold it to accommodate his desire for unchecked power.\u201d Mr. Weissmann was equally scathing about Attorney General William P. Barr, calling him an enabler and likening as a betrayal and \u201cgut punch.\u201d Mr. Weissmann also criticized colleagues, portraying the special counsel team as divided between aggressive investigators like him, the F.B.I. special agent Omer Meisel and the prosecutor Jeannie Rhee \u2014 who headed \u201cTeam R,\u201d which investigated Russian issues other than those centered on Manafort \u2014 and far more risk-averse law enforcement officials like Mr. Zebley who pulled punches. In one episode in 2017, the Mueller team issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank for information about Mr. Manafort\u2019s income in Ukraine. Deutsche Bank had also lent large sums to the Trump Organization, and the White House somehow found out about the still-secret subpoenas \u2014 though not their focus. The White House demanded to know what investigators were doing, and Mr. Mueller authorized Mr. Zebley to tell the White House that they had not been seeking Mr. Trump\u2019s financial information. \u201cAt that point, any financial investigation of Trump was put on hold,\u201d Mr. Weissmann writes. \u201cThat is, we backed down \u2014 the issue was simply too incendiary; the risk, too severe.\u201d The book provides many other examples of concessions large and small. Investigators did not try to question Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka \u2014 who had spoken in the lobby to a delegation of Russians who came to Trump Tower in June 2016 to meet with campaign leaders who had been promised that they were offering dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. They \u201cfeared that hauling her in for an interview would play badly to the already antagonistic right-wing press \u2014 \u2014 and risk enraging Trump, provoking him to shut down the special counsel\u2019s office once and for all,\u201d he wrote. Similarly, they did not subpoena the Trump Organization for emails about its efforts to develop a Trump-branded building in Moscow, which were active deep into the 2016 campaign. And they did not immunize Mr. Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., a step that would have prevented him from being able to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying about matters like the Trump Tower meeting. Bound by grand-jury secrecy rules, Mr. Weissmann did not come out and say whether Donald Trump Jr. was threatened with or actually issued a subpoena and used his right against self-incrimination to repel it. Mr. Weissmann laid much of the blame for what he saw as a pattern of timidity on Mr. Zebley, portraying him as a primary decision maker. \u201cRepeatedly during our 22 months in operation, we would reach some critical juncture in our investigation only to have Aaron say that we could not take a particular action because it risked aggravating the president beyond some undefined breaking point.\u201d Mr. Weissmann acknowledged, but did not clearly address, concerns that the aging Mr. Mueller had lost a step, both declaring that he was capable of making the tough decisions despite \u201cspeculative concerns\u201d about his health but also describing him in one scene as looking drained and worn down by his years of grueling public service. While Mr. Zebley obtained Mr. Mueller\u2019s sanction for many of his cautious directives, in one striking episode, Mr. Zebley appeared in Mr. Weissmann\u2019s telling to have unilaterally agreed \u2014 without Mr. Mueller\u2019s knowledge \u2014 to a request by the office of the deputy attorney general overseeing them, Rod J. Rosenstein, not to coordinate with state prosecutors \u201cas it would undermine the president\u2019s pardon power.\u201d Two other former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disputed the account. Mr. Rosenstein did not decline any request to share information with state prosecutors, a person familiar with his thinking wrote in an email. Another person familiar with how the special counsel\u2019s office interacted with Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s office denied that there had been any agreement about sharing evidence with or withholding it from state prosecutors, and said Mr. Zebley had consulted with Mr. Mueller on every material decision. On the failure to subpoena Mr. Trump, Mr. Mueller was determined to avoid \u201cany public disagreements\u201d with Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Weissmann wrote. Because the special counsel regulations required telling Congress about any instance in which Mr. Rosenstein overruled him, Mr. Mueller never actually proposed subpoenaing Mr. Trump, instead coyly asking what Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s reaction would be. Mr. Rosenstein just kept demurring. In the end, Mr. Weissmann said in an interview, the caution was more justified early on to avoid provoking Mr. Trump into firing them before they could get going. But he and Ms. Rhee, among others, believed the office should have been willing to be more aggressive later on, after they had learned much of what Russia had done and had already used indictments to drag it into public view. \u201cWe would have subpoenaed the president after he refused our accommodations, even if that risked us being fired,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t sit right. We were left feeling like we had let down the American public, who were counting on us to give it our all.\u201d "},
{"text": "For many people around the world, the coronavirus pandemic has been an excuse to learn a homey new skill like knitting or pastry-making. For Russians, it\u2019s all about the mushrooms. \u201cI go every other day and can\u2019t get enough. I want more, more, more,\u201d says Svetlana Gladysheva, who has had more time than usual to hunt for fungi in the woods, because the theater where she runs a cafeteria was closed. \u201cMy husband told me: \u2018I\u2019m afraid to lose you. Mushrooms have kidnapped you,\u2019 \u201d she adds. Foraging for mushrooms is a longstanding tradition in Russia. According to a 2019 survey by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, nearly half the population in the biggest cities, St. Petersburg and Moscow, participate. That was before the pandemic left people with limited travel options and more time on their hands. This year, a St. Petersburg-focused mushrooming group on the social-media site VK has nearly doubled to over 39,000, according to Anton Kubyshkin, the administrator of the St. Petersburg-focused group. Pickers compete on their gathering rates of mushrooms per hour and show off their cupboards laden with Mason jars filled with marinated and salted fungi, a staple of Russian cuisine. It doesn\u2019t hurt that this has been a banner year for mushrooms in the boreal forests hugging St. Petersburg. \u201cMushrooms started coming in very early and in huge quantities,\u201d said Alexey Prozorov, who took a break from taxi driving to make a living selling these gifts of the forest this summer. Early each morning Mr. Prozorov puts on rain boots and heads out to the boggy woods of pine, fir, birch and aspen with a thermos of coffee and a pack of cigarettes. He arranges to sell the mushrooms via online social networks straight from the woods. One of the record setters is Natalya Pudovkina, who brings in such heavy hauls that she buys special baskets made out of extra-resilient vines shipped from America, she says. Ms. Pudovkina says an obsession with mushroom picking is an \u201cinherited disease\u201d in her case, and she is sometimes joined on mushrooming hunts by her 91-year-old grandmother. Ms. Pudovkina, a nurse who worked long shifts in a hospital treating Covid-19 patients earlier this year, was worried she\u2019d miss out on the season altogether. Back in May she posted a photo of herself from the hospital, wearing a white hazmat suit, goggles, and shoe covers, holding a handwritten sign in her gloved hands that read: \u201cHave the mushrooms come in yet?\u201d Her patience was rewarded. Ms. Pudovkina set a personal record, gathering about a 1,000 mushrooms with her mom on a three-hour hunt. \u201cIt was horrific,\u201d Ms. Pudovkina said about the long night her entire family spent cleaning, freezing, drying and marinating the mushrooms. The next day Ms. Pudovkina was back in the woods. Something else driving the mania this year in St. Petersburg is the common appearance of the coveted king bolete, known as porcini by Italians. These mushrooms grow in complex symbiotic relationships with the surrounding trees, and scientists know little about what affects their growth, according to Liudmila B. Kalinina, a junior researcher in the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Encountering a king bolete, with its bulbous white stem, crowned by a reddish brown cap with a porous white underside, let alone filling a whole basket with the mushroom, creates a high and pushes foragers to return to the woods for their next fix. When Ms. Gladysheva, the head of the theater cafeteria, first gets to the forest, often at the break of dawn, she first sees just the moss, the dry leaves, and the branches sprinkled with dew. But then she spots a mushroom. \u201cI want to squeal from joy. I feel like a puppy greeting its owner,\u201d Ms. Gladysheva says about finding fungi. On a recent trip Ms. Gladysheva and a friend quickly packed two baskets with mushrooms, as well as a jacket that they used as an extra sack. On the way back to the car, they lost their way, had to cross a river on a narrow log and tear through a thick forest full of tall nettle. Then they got drenched in a downpour. Did they consider leaving some of the mushrooms to free their hands? \u201cAre you kidding? That\u2019s our catch. That\u2019s our precious cargo. We still got home happy.\u201d Mushroom picking can even improve relationships, according to Svetlana Kostyanaya, a beautician whose business was put on hold for a while during the pandemic. While cooped up at home she was having more arguments with her husband, but their new hobby helped. \u201cWhen we fill our baskets, peace and love sets in,\u201d Ms. Kostyanaya says. On the other hand, it can also cause stress as friends compete on the same terrain. Earlier this summer, Ms. Pudovkina, the nurse, invited Mr. Kubyshkin, the social-media administrator, to join her. And when he saw Ms. Pudovkina\u2019s secret mushroom patches, Mr. Kubyshkin says, he lost his mind. Between July 20 and Aug. 3, he returned to that same area nine times, getting to the forest at 3 a.m., just as the sun was about to rise in the northern region, picking and then going to work exhausted. \u201cOne time I did feel a little guilty and apologized,\u201d he says about poaching Ms. Pudovkina\u2019s locations. Yana Oparina got serious about the \u201cquiet hunt\u201d\u2014a Russian name for mushrooming\u2014this year. At age 32, she learned how to use a compass via YouTube and got a vuvuzela that she blows into upon arrival in the woods to scare off any wild animals. She works on a remote basis this year and has arranged her schedule around her mushroom hunts, she says. Not all of her trips were successful. Ms. Oparina has gotten lost, her friend sank thigh deep in a bog, and she had to dump one day\u2019s worth of picking after learning the mushrooms grew too near an industrial site. The deer flies, however, have been the worst. \u201cEvery time I go to the woods, I experience a psychosis because of these deer flies,\u201d Ms. Oparina says. \u201cThey crawl in your hair, they crawl all over you, they cause horrible discomfort.\u201d Still, she adds, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t stop me because I really love picking mushrooms.\u201d Copyright \u00a92020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

{"text": "The term Trump derangement syndrome is useful for what it doesn\u2019t presume. People in the media are said to be so passionate in their loathing of Donald Trump that it clouds their judgment, but are they really passionate? Do they really care 1/50th as much as they do about whether their kids are doing well in school or their cup holder keeps their coffee out of their laps? These are things that we care about. The rage invested in abstract politics is almost always displaced concern about our own status. Fake news, in this sense, is largely a fallout from everyday conformist virtue-signaling among individuals involved in news reporting. Catherine Herridge. All reporters coming up learn that official government statements are newsworthy. Ms. Herridge forgets to forget this when it comes to Trump-related matters. An official letter from Attorney General William Barr to Sen. Lindsey Graham, she reported on Thursday, reveals declassified details of an FBI investigation from 2009-11\u2014i.e., before Mr. Trump entered presidential politics\u2014of the unnamed primary source (his name is Igor Danchenko) in the Steele dossier. A Brookings Institution colleague reported that Mr. Danchenko, in 2008, dangled money for classified information. An FBI follow-up found contacts with a known Russian intelligence agent, meetings at the Russian Embassy. Mr. Danchenko even angled for a job there. We knew some in the FBI feared the Steele dossier was tainted by Russian disinformation. Now we know why. Compare this story, with real facts, with stories that have filled the press lately\u2014a flood of commentary suggesting that Mr. Trump is a Russian agent after all because Robert Mueller didn\u2019t prove a negative; if the special counsel failed to find evidence, it demonstrates that he didn\u2019t look hard enough. One example: Author and reporter Tim Weiner, in the Washington Post, once in his own words and once in a source\u2019s words, states as a that Mr. Trump has bent policy and betrayed American interests to suit the Kremlin. But he doesn\u2019t say how. It can\u2019t be because the Trump administration sent defensive arms to Ukraine, sought to block the Nord Stream 2 pipeline or destroyed a column of Russian mercenaries in Syria. Is it because he wants to reduce U.S. troops in Germany? There could be other reasons: Russia poses no conventional threat to Germany, Mr. Trump thinks Germans should pay more for their own defense, the U.S. is simultaneously increasing its commitment to the vulnerable Baltic nations. Or is it because Mr. Trump denies or plays down Russian meddling in the 2016 election? But Mr. Trump would be an idiot not to understand the issue is raised only to attack him. Russia would not be an issue otherwise. In 2001, President Bush chose to do business with Mr. Putin despite the all-but-certain Kremlin hand in a series of apartment block bombings\u2014blamed on Chechen terrorists\u2014that killed hundreds of Russians in their beds. In 2009, President Obama favored Mr. Putin with a \u201creset\u201d despite his invasion of Georgia, a country seeking NATO membership. Why? Because there was no press or political reward in the U.S. for doing anything else. The only real difference today is that Mr. Trump has not put anything like the same effort into rehabilitating Mr. Putin that his predecessors did, leading business delegations to Moscow, offering agreements, acquiescing in events like the Olympics. Here\u2019s some news: Many of our \u201cbest\u201d reporters are creatures of confirmation bias. They doggedly find what they are looking for even if it isn\u2019t there. They doggedly ignore that which doesn\u2019t fit. Because some staffer, in a Senate Intelligence Committee report, ad-libbed that Konstantin Kilimnik, Paul Manafort\u2019s lobbying partner, was a \u201cRussian intelligence officer,\u201d the media now treat this as gospel, even though the Mueller report, which actually had access to U.S. intelligence, made no such claim. We in the press have only symbols on a page\u2014the words \u201cemails of Clinton\u201d in the notes of an FBI interrogator\u2014for what transpired in London in 2016 between the two ludicrously unimportant figures George Papadopoulos and Joseph Mifsud. Yet CNN consistently interprets these words to mean stolen Democratic National Committee emails rather than the more obvious Hillary Clinton emails that everyone knew about. Only this supposition, in turn, supports the presumption that Mr. Mifsud was a Russian agent, with high connections in the Kremlin, rather than just another charlatan pretending to be \u201cin the know.\u201d Readers complain that I\u2019m ungentlemanly for saying that in the media, on top of a dishonesty problem, we have a stupidity problem. But we do. Copyright \u00a92020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
